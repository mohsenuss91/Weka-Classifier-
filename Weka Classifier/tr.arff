'I arrived for a 3-day business stay. Altough the public areas are extremely grand and have been lovingly restored the same can\'t be said for the bedrooms. I was initially given a room on the 5th floor. This floor doesn\'t appear to have been given any updates as it was sparse and reminded me of a hotel room in the 80\'s.When I complained I was told that i\'d only booked a single room. I wasthen given a room on the 3rd floor which wasmore like a cleaners cupboard whichhadbeen converted. It may have been more modern but the facilities werevery poor.There was no room to move around. theinternet didn\'t work, the iron leaked and the towel rail didn\'t work.Having a bed next to the wall also meant regular disruption after hitting my head. When I complained i was told the hotel was full.I left after 1 night and booked into another hotel.A hotel I might addthat doesn\'t discriminate lone travellers and especially not those spending more than1 night in the hotel.',neg
'We booked this hotel without reading any reviews, it was too late to change our minds by the time we did. On arriving we tried to park our average sized family car in the hotel\'s carpark which was next to impossible, take our advice get there early the car park has limited spaces and be prepared for the fact it costs £10 a day to park. When we got to reception we were greeted by a warm friendly and helpful receptionist, we were given a room on the fifth floor, in a hotel of this size we would expect more than just the one lift, we opened our room door and were puzzled as to why it didn\'t resemble the photo on the hotel\'s website, afterall this is a four star hotel, AA rating no less, The room was in a sorry state,dirty peeling wallpaper, filthy dirty net curtians, rotton window frames, with most of the paint peeling off, the bed was saggy and dilapidated, but clean enough, TV with no remote control and no mini fridge, seems picky but remember this is a supposed four star hotel. The bathroom was large but again did little to resemble the websites description, no two sinks in this room just a badly chipped bath complete with off white shower mat. We awoke the next morning and went down to breakfast, the receptionist at the resturant was again warm friendly and very helpful, the resturant was everything that the room wasn\'t, spotlessly clean, excellent food and helpful attentitive staff, overall the rooms let this charming hotel down, would we stay here again, I have to be honest and say no.

'The hotel promised so much but delivered little. The hotel itself is not in the best of locations, it looks like an idyllic location, but in reality it is situated in a noisy dirty tourist town. The constant noise from the street competes with the hotel piping music constantly (we wish you a merry Christmas from 08:00  19:00) Added to that the local communist loudspeaker announcements and the local church with ear-splitting carols. If you add in the smell of sewage, a closed bar and local dogs barking through the night it was not a pleasant stay. We left two days early. It is a shame because the staff were helpful, probably the only saving grace.',neg
'Me and my partner stayed here 1 night in November. I had been offered a cheap deal by one of the staff I knew so we thought it would be a good base for a night out in Leeds.Apparently we had one of the nicer rooms(!), but it still smelt of stale smoke and was extremely small. Although the room was small the bathroom was huge but with no shelves or surfaces to put anything on and actually nothing in there but the sink, bath and toilet. It just seemed like a complete waste of space. The tiles in the bathroom were mouldy, even though the decor was modern, the sheets had burn holes in them and instead of air conditioning there was a large fan (taking up more of the valuble space).The window barely opened but even if it had more we were dubious about making the room cold as the tiny radiator didn\'t produce much heat so instead we had to put up with the smell of stale smoke.Our television remote didn\'t work so I had to take it to Reception and exchange it and just i general this place just felt like a 1/2* hotel masquerading as 4* .I would not stay here again, ever. Good location and I agree that the night porter is very helpful, but other than that I have nothing good to say about this place. Better to stay at Park Plaza.Liked &#x2014 nothingDisliked &#x2014 the smelly, tiny roomTips/Secrets &#x2014 don\'t go here',neg

'Never stayed with gateway before and this is the first time. Had stayed with other Taj properties but this hotel is avoidable in Cochin. On the first day, the juice for breakfast was spoilt and on the second day, the yogurt was spoilt. The fitness and Ayurveda center on the top floor is small and dingy. Use of the gym could be dangerous as it is too small for its purpose. Not sure if the rooms are sound proof too, while sleeping during the day - I could hear the phone rigning in the next room. The only saving grace are the hotel staffs - they are excellent.',neg
'The Park lacks the class and elegance that other hotels/resorts in its class possess. The property is decently maintained and its location is definitely a plus. However the private beach is dirty and we were unable to stay on the beach longer than fifteen minutes.The hotel is being renovated and we were allotted an \'ocean facing\' room where we had a view of an upcoming construction and practically no ocean. We had a toddler with us and we tried bathing her in the evening and there was no hot water. We heated water in the tea coffee kettle and managed.The worst part however was the music from the pub. We were given a room on the second floor and apparently weekends are \'pub nights. \' it was clear that there was no sound proofing done and there was a loud insistent Techno bass echo that went on for five hours. We were tired and thankfully our toddler fell asleep I was awake in bed until 2 am waiting for the music to stop. I called the reception enquiring about the noise and I was told that I had to endure it for another hour and that there was nothing they could do. My husband reached his breaking point and after wandering the hotel grounds for 30 minutes, demanded a separate room on a higher floor. Needless to say, he was very upset and the staff was quick to see this and allotted him a room on the 4th floor free of cost. The staff are nice enough, but appear inexperienced and lack the warmth and demeanor required if you\'re in the hospitality industry.I understand the novotel hotel will open on varun beach this December. I\'d put my money there instead.',neg
'We booked for this hotel with last minute.com on the \'secret rooms\' part getting a Sat night for £50 instead of £76. I was dumb struck when I opened the door to the room ! It was approx 12ft c 12ft with a 3 quarter bed pushed into the corner! This was meant to be a double standard room. We complained and refused to stay in that room.as they were full ( apparently ) the found us another room in the beautiful Hilton hotel diwn the road ! I would NEVER book for the hotel again Not only that another couple were also complaining for same issue however they paid £150 for one night B&ampB and evening meal. They were given another room in the end. Positive side the manager did all he could to find us other accommodation. We also got taxi journeys on account.

'We booked a room through lastminute.com purely because of the picture on the website. However, the room allocated was on the 5th floor and was very disappointing. The floor was creaky and the room was very much in need of redecoration. The paint was falling off the window ledge which was also in need of cleaning. Of particular concern was the kettle which was far from clean inside. Overall the room was not of a 4 star standard although the communal areas were much better.However, the buffet breakfast was good.So make sure you are booking for the right room!

'My husband and I stayed here recently, we paid for a \'double room\' but on arrival we found the bed to be a fraction bigger than a single. I called down to reception to complain and after speaking to a rude receptionist I was passed over to the duty manager who told me that the hotel was full and we couldn\'t be upgraded to a better room and that the bed was considered a standard double for the hotel. Despite having a four star status, our room lacked a mini bar and I was charged for my morning newspaper which should be a complimentary service for any hotel that is four stars or above. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone and we will certainly not be returning.',neg

'We booked our company xmas do here on 01/12/06 and in total we had about 10 rooms. All the other people in our party had rooms on the 4th Floor, which was really nice and modern. Although the rooms were quite small, they were really nicely decorated. My friend and I then made our way up to our room on the 5th Floor. The minute the lift opened it looked like a different hotel!! Our room was large, but it smelled horrible. There was a really stale smell of smoke and damp. There was also holes in the walls and the whole place looked like it hadn\'t been decorated since the seventies!! I immediately rang reception to ask them if it was a smoking room (since we had booked a non smoking one) and they said it was. I asked if they could move us to a non smoking room and was told quite abruptly no. I then asked if they could just move us to any other room and again I was told no. The only thing they could do was get housekeeping up to open the window. When I informed them that the window was already open when we came in, they said they would send housekeeping up with an air freshner!After seeing the photos on the website and also seeing the other rooms that our party were staying in, I felt really disappointed with this hotel. We also heard other guests chatting to each other in the lift and they were all complaining about rooms on the 5th Floor. The only good thing about the hotel was the night porter, who when we returned from our night out, was very helpful in getting us drinks etc.Liked &#x2014 The night porter and events manager were very helpfulDisliked &#x2014 the rooms on the 5th floor are horribleTips/Secrets &#x2014 Don\'t stay on the 5th Floor!',neg
'I booked a hotel room via the hotel website. Then I received an automatically confirmation and everything seems to be fine. One week later I got an Cancellation Confirmation but I did NOT cancel anything.

Terrible Service!',neg
'Was persuaded by corporate booking agent to try this place instead of my normal option in Leeds (Bewleys). B&ampB deal was £15 cheaper per night...why not to save some cash? Looking at the website you get a deceptive view of an up to date, chic hotel. It boils my blood when chains buy up \'heritage\' properties, give them a cheap makeover and leave the place looking as unloved as it did before the makover, but just in new shades of beige and brown. The staff at breakfast were to be commended, warm, friendly and efficient. The check in staff should learn to smile and work quickly. Rubbish choice of room service food, and the desert I got in no way did it resemble the description, for £6+ you would expect some accuracy. Worst night\'s sleep in years thanks to the crack under the door letting in lots of light, an unpleasant smell from the bathroom and poorly fitting windows that let in noise. Housekeeping not a priority, found papers relating to a previous occupant in a drawer, there were stains and marks on the curtains and bedding. Nasty. Bathroom layout so small and awkward it was impossible to switch on the shower without first climbing into the bath (over the toilet) and enduring cold water before you could work out how to get hot water. unless you need to go cheap, don\'t bother.',neg

'Stayed at this hotel for a romantic break away, booked it via another website but when we arrived the room we were allocated was on the 5th floor and it was far from a 4*rating, the bed was broken, the room looked dirty, the bathroom was stained and the bathroom door would not close. We were not happy!!!! We went down to reception to express our disatisfaction, the gentleman we spoke to was very good he explained that some of the rooms were waiting to be renovated but he would move us to another room, he expained that the standard rooms did have an extra charge but the hotel would meet this cost for us. The room we were given was lovely, the bed was very comfortable and the staff friendly and the room looked as advertised on the website. (3rd floor)I would say that to avoid disappointment I would avoid anything on the 5th floor, the 4th floor I cannot comment on but we found our stay more than comfortable on the 3rd floor.',neg
'On checking in I specifically asked for a room in a quiet location. I was told that the room we had been allocated (203) would be fine because it faced a quiet alleyway. WRONG! At about 5.30am the hotel bins started to be emptied into a lorry parked in the \'quiet\' alleyway under our room. This continued for about 45 minutes after which it wasn\'t possible to get back to sleep. The noise was more noticeable because the windows were badly fitting, old and single pane.The room was also next to the stairs so we frequently heard the fire doors banging.Not only that, the room was tiny, the bed a small (very soft) double and the bathroom very cramped. I wondered whether the hotel thought I was staying on my own and had allocated me a small room because there was also only one shower gel &amp shampoo but when I queried this I was told that that was the same size of all double rooms.Afterwards I found out that this wasn\'t the case!Finally, the room was really hot but we couldn\'t open the window because of the noise outside. The only saving grace was that when I checked out and complained about the noise in my sleep deprived state, I was given complimentary breakfast so that I could have a coffee to wake myself up!How hard can it be for staff to know which rooms are quiet? Never again The Met!',neg

'How would you rank a hotel that overbooks like a budget airline, so that when you show up with your reservation they tell you you don\'t have a room?This is a hotel that pretends to be classy but in reality treats its customers no better than Travelodge or Motel 6.

'This place is for the ayurvedic treetment purpose not for the family to spend the life, I have got some 3000 gift voucher for 2 night 3 days, i went by car from bangalore, if you dont have car please dont go..., we drived around 400km and found the place palakkad, we thought its hilly station but its not that..after we asked for the Kairali which is 10km from palakkad, once we reached there we felt we have taken wrong decision, food was worst like patients serverd kind but you need to pay 300 for that, the resort guys only intersted in foreign people as they come for ayurvedic and pay handsome money like 60k for 1 week, if indian goes they wont care tall, we got bored and though to go out we came to know there is falls in place DHONI after driving 25KM from resort, we came to know they are not allowing people to go fot the falls. and there is no much places to see and also food is worst and language problem, there people cant speak hindi also, so you can servive if you know malayalam only.please dont go to this place,',neg
'We booked this hotel because we got a cheap deal through Travelzoo. We have stayed at this hotel before in one of the contemporary rooms which aren\'t bad but nothing special. Upon check-in I asked if there was a contemporary room available - I was advised that the hotel was fully booked so we had been allocated a standard room. The room in question - 601 was actually up on the very top floor. There is only one creaky lift in the place which goes up to the 5 floor only so we then had to carry our bags up a further 2 lots of stairs - we were not offered any help with them by the miserable and unhelpful staff on the reception. Once we got into the room we were shocked with the general state of it - as another Trip Advisor reviewer has said - do not be fooled into thinking that all of the rooms are going to be like the rooms pictured on the website. How they can even use the \'standard rooms\' and class them as 4 star is beyond me. The room was extremely hot - there was no air conditioning and the furniture was like something the charity shop would reject. The floor was creaky and the room was in need of redecoration. The paint was falling off the window ledge which was also in need of cleaning. There were also cobwebs and dirt everywhere. There was a fan in the wardrobe which we got out because we were so hot and it was black with dirt - needless to say we did not use this. The kettle boiled but did not switch itself off so was a potential fire hazzard. The bathroom again was filthy - the shower curtain had brown stains all over it.Breakfast was nice - that was the only good thing about this hotel!Upon check-out we were not even asked if we had had a nice stay etc - they are probably used to getting compaints so dont ask!We have stayed at many hotels in Leeds - this is by far the worst - AVOID!',neg
'Stayed here for three nights to relax after Cairo and a Nile cruise. Hotel facilities are of the highest quality and service is generally excellent. Hotel is isolated and quiet which is fine if that is what you are looking for but there is a general lack of atmosphere. It felt like an elegant sanatorium (not that I have ever been to one) or a celebrity \'drying out\' clinic. What really annoyed me was the price of food and drink which is trully exorbitant even by the standards of other high quality hotels in Egypt. And let\'s not forget the automatic 12.5\% service charge levieed on everything, even the bottled water. We had gone on an Oberoi Nile cruise and stayed at the Oberoi in Cairo both of which are expensive but not to the level found in Hurghada. Examples include paying over £30 for two burgers and cokes for lunch and being offered a packet of Pringles crisps for £7.50 from the mini bar. We were told by our tour rep not to book taxis through the hotel as they charge twice as much as through a tour company. This level of pricing has to be driven by the lack of nearby alternatives. It felt like the hotel recognises it has a \'captive\' audience and is determined to milk it for as much as it can. Altogether it left us feeling ripped off and no level of quality or service can compensate for that.',neg
'I went there for a job-related meeting and the secretary of the company I visited booked me a room in this hotel, so I didn\'t have a say in choosing this hotel. I still thought it looked like a nice hotel, and it is in a very central location so I was quite excited to be able to stay there.When I got there I was shown a room with lots of exhaust noise, with a double bed. I asked the reception person (who turned out to be the manager) to show me another room that didn\'t have that much noise. Then she showed me a tiny room with a bed half the size of the one in the noisy room. Then I asked her whether it was possible to get any room that would be bigger than the tiny room without much noise, she told me only smoking rooms would be available. The smoking room was full of smoke smell, because this hotel does not have any air conditioning in the rooms. Nor could I open any of the windows. So I settled for the extremely tiny room (without ventilation, but it was without much noise/smoke). That was the tiniest room I stayed in in England. The breakfast which would otherwise cost 15 pounds was in a dining room on the ground floor. There was also a lot of noise coming from some fan, so I couldn\'t even read the newspaper I brought with me. Then, on the checkout, a very disgruntled receptionist told me I needed to pay for the newspaper that was delivered to my door. I have never been charged for a newspaper without being told that it would cost so I contested the charge. The receptionist was so rude (and I thought I had seen the worst already) and refused to help. The manager came out after five minutes of my waiting and erased the charge because she was the one who simply asked whether I wanted a newspaper or not in the morning without telling me that it would cost 70p. It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed, because of the attitudes (and meanness) of the staff, total lack of ventilation in the rooms, and generally deserted feeling of the whole establishment. I am very good at finding at least one nice point about any hotel. But the Met, I cannot find any positive factor that makes it recommendable in any way. The location may be prime but at night the area gets very deserted, without anything in the immediate environs. If you like a very soft bed, you might like the bedding.Disliked &#x2014 unhelpful (and mean) staffTips/Secrets &#x2014 smokers might appreciate it, many of the rooms are smoking rooms and are very smoky',neg
'I don\'t think this hotel would get four stars in any country other than England. While the foyer has certainly been decorated to four-star standard, the rooms are seriously in need of renovation. Window frames were crumbling, curtains were filthy and the lack of double glazing meant constant traffic noise. Noise from inside the hotel was even worse, especially as my room was right next to the lift. Spend your money elsewhere.Liked &#x2014 Central locationDisliked &#x2014 No double glazing',neg
'My wife and I stayed at the Gateway Hotel Cochin during our honeymoon around Kerala. We liked the location as it was near the city and we could do our shopping and eatouts. But at night the corridors were incredibly noisy. There were some bunch of drunk bachelors, or tourists visiting, I dont knw who were howling throughout the night. Even after complaining to the reception the noise persisted. May be a one off thing. In terms of room, the rooms were clean, there was an half empty soda bottle in the mini bar, which they promptly replaced. We were planning to stay for three days but had to check out the next night itself. check out was easy, and I did register my complaint. Probably the quality of guests cannot be controlled, but this sure is not - there is NO flexible pipes in the bathroom to clean yourself :-) , Only Mug and Tissue paper!!So...yeah if you are Indian be ready for some cup cleaning..really big turn off for us.',neg
'booked through laterooms.com. Searched a few hotels and picked this one as it was a little bit more expensive, it sounded good and the pictures were nice. I was very very disapointed. The room was TINY with single bed. I wasnt able to book in for nearly 2 hours as they had a problem with the water. A few people were waiting in the lobby to check in and not once they they come over and offer a complimentary drink- which i think would have gone a long way. When i eventually checked in the room was tiny and freezing cold. I rang down to complain and she told me to wait for heat to come on ( it was 7pm!) and turn the knob. I told her it didnt work and she said she would send someone up. She didnt. I waited 45 minutes and eventually rang down again, where she acted like i never rang in the 1st place. She said its probably the water problem ( do you think)?!! and if everyone else had the problem she would send the blow heater. at this stage i was wrapped in scarf and throw over. I ordered room service which was not that nice and watched a movie in which the sound quality was so bad i had to turn it off. Plus, i was sure i read they had wi-fi only to discover it was broadband and you had to pay 50p per minute!!you also had to pay for parking, when it doesnt say that on the webiste. in summary, dont be fooled.',neg
'Hi,This is for everyone who are not always lucky .I went to Vizag last weekend to spend a relaxing holiday. I had booked myself at The Park after going through all the reviews at various websites. They were offering a 3 nights 4 day tour package.I was duly picked up after reaching Vizag. After an okay check-in, I went upto the room to drop my luggage. I was in for a big surprise. The room was pretty normal without any carpets. The bed was a wrought iron bed of a size bit smaller than the normal queen size. The basin and bathtub had water logging issues. the shower does not work. The bathroom is so badly litup that I could hardly shave. The furniture is all rustic and dirty. I was double checking every surface before keeping my stuff. The view of the sea is good. But with a foul smelling bathroom and an untidy room, no amount of beach view really attracted me. I called up the management and asked them to rectify the room. But as you can see from my description, there were lots of things which were wrong therein. I then checked out their superior rooms which were somewhat cleaner but not of the standard of The Park. I have stayed at The Park in Chennai, Calcutta and Gangtok. But this facility in Vizag is not even remotely close to the standards. I was very shocked. I checked out in flat 20 minutes, lost 2000 INR and booked myself in Taj Residency. Taj lived upto its standards. I paid almost the same money as in The Park. I did not have a private beach..but then it was not my honeymoon where I liked to be the only one having a beer on the beach with my wife. So I enjoyed the beach as any other traveller. It was a long weekend and there was a decent crowd. But I never missed anything like the private beach experience of The Park. So folks, I might be the first one to write up this..but please be careful. You might check the rooms and facilities before checking in..so that you donot lose money and have a misadventure like mine.

'I stayed here because a company that had hired me to do some training for them had booked the hotel for the training on the following day. I arrived at around 9.50pm, and was told that the restaurant was closed, although I could order room service. My room was on the 6th floor, but the elevator only goes up to the 5th floor. The room itself was in the attic, with a sloping roof, very old-fashioned, and the wireless internet did not reach my room. There was no air-conditioning in my room, and the window only opened four inches, so I slept poorly. The bathroom was clean, but dingy, and the hot water for the shower lasted about 2 minutes, and then went cold. The service in the restaurant was friendly, but inept. When I asked for tea, on both occasions it took ten minutes to arrive. More importantly, breakfast did not begin until 7am fine for those on vacation, but not geared to the needs of business travellers. I won\'t be going back.',neg
'Despite the positive reviews, with which I generally agree, I must ask: Who would want to stay at a hotel -- any of the Taj hotels -- that charge dual rates, one for people who appear to be Indian and have Indian surnames and a much higher rate for all others. Yes, I know. Taj policy requires Indians living abroad to pay the foreigners\' rate, but I\'ve never seen the desk clerk as for evidence of an Indian residence, and I\'ve seen many, many Indians resident abroad paying the Indians rate.',neg
'Based on other reviews, the hotel sounds nice.I attempted to book directly with Oberoi Reservations but after being given an itinerary on a 8Night Package (Udaipur, Delhi, Agra) they then found that they had no rooms available and wanted to rearrange my trip, which would have required me to reschedule 4 flights and 2 train trips.The root problem is that the staff can\'t hold rooms apparently while the vacation is being planned and there is no way to book the 8,10,12 night vacation package inmmediately online that I can find.One would think if your planning a week+ of travel with them at over $5K USD they would be able to handle it.I unfortunately wasn\'t able to get past the booking process with them.I ended up booking the Leela instead -- it took about 10 minutes thru their website, as opposed to my adventure with reservations@oberoigroup.comI\'d suggest ignoring the descriptions of 8,10,12 night exotic vacations package on their website which requires contacting Oberoi directly and just book a regular stay thru the website for each destination. If I had done that, I\'d probably have had a better experience or at least a reservation.',neg
'I think the title says it all. Turned up at the hotel after an evening out (approx midnight) and the door was locked. I was stood outside for at least 20 minutes ringing the bell before 2 staff came along - why wasn\'t one on reception? No apology was given. By the time I got in the hotel I was fuming (remember, I didn\'t know they would be 20 mins, as far as I knew I was locked out all night and was thinking about booking in somewhere else). Also in the morning there was no hot water. Apparently one boiler had broken, and the other didn\'t work. Great. Fortunately for me I could get a shower at work, but this would be terrible for other people.I\'ve stayed in the Met before and it was OK, but the above two things happening on the same day mean I will never stay there again. Who wants to stay in a hotel they might not be let into, and not be able to get a shower? Utterly, utterly rubbish.',neg
'My Wife and I booked this hotel for a Birthday weekend. We paid extra for a Contemporary Double.We parked at the hotel at 12.15pm on the Saturday and had to pay an extra £10 for every 24 hours. I have never had to pay extra for car parking at the many other 4* hotels that we have stayed in acos the country. Whilst the public areas were fine if rather faded the room ( No 314 for the record) was atrocious! It was small, dark and shabby. We had a view of the fire escape and how it could be classed as contempory I don\'t know. We wondered what the standard rooms would be like! There was insufficient lighting which made it difficult to see in the mirrors. It was like living in a half light. Awful!The bathroom was so tiny that we could only enter one at once, there were few toiletries so we were so glad that we brought our own. No fridge (all ther 4 star hotels we have stayed in have had a minbar/fridge), only 3 tea bags with no choice, and not even a biscuit. The sink in the bathroom was clearly designed for a dwarf such that it was almost impossible to fit the ketttle under the tap to fill it!!There was a huge hole in the door that had been roughly filled with bare plaster! Had someone attempted to escape?There were insufficient pillows for the bed and despite several attempts to get hold of Housekeeping or Reception we just gave up tryng to get hold of more.The wardrobe was small but adequate but a huge electric fan sat in there which obstructed the hanging sapce so we ended up having to drag it out to hang our clothes properly.Breakfast was of a standard 2 star B&ampB quality.Our advice if travelling to Leeds is to try the City Inn, Radisson, Thorpe Park Spa or 42 The Calls. Avoid this one if you want an enjoyable stay.',neg
'My girlfriend and I took trip over to Willingdon Island, Cochin, to try out the spa treatments at the Taj hotel only to find that the spa was being renovated on the same day. The staff advised that the spa would be open the next day so we booked in for massage treatments and some general pampering. We were told that we could utilise the pool facilities being as we were booked in for Rs5000 (£65) worth of treatments.The next day we took the ferry over to the hotel looking forward to relaxing by the pool, a spot of lunch and our treatments. Upon arriving the same woman who had booked us in for the treatments the day before completely denied that she had said that we could use the pool facilities and wanted to charge us an extra Rs1000 for the privilage. These people really don\'t understand the concept of good customer service do they!We were willing to pay Rs5000 for treatments and expect to use the pool at the same time but not be charged an extra Rs1000. I promtly told her to cancel all the treatments and debit my credit card just Rs1000 as we would only be using the pool facilities for the rest of the day.Her face turned to stone at the thought of the canceled appointments, missing out on the extra Rs4000 and that fact that we were staying around all day to rub it in.Needless to say that we used as many towels as we could, made as much noise as we could and generally made her aware all day long of her bad attitude and poor customer service skills.I understand that hotels such as the Taj Group are quite expensive and the majority of their guests have money to throw away, but with the money grabbing attitude of the Lady who was running the Spa centre it is certainly not a place I would recommend or return to.',neg
'Have been to the met before for a conference so knew the main facilities were ok, but immediately entering the room I was disappointed. Fifth floor twin with little room to swing a cat, and as some other revieweres have noted, very dated, shabby and lacking in any facilities.The bar and restaurant were staffed by friendly, if somewhat undertrained staff who were helpful but not overly on the ball with service. The food was fine and room service was quick.I would rather have stayed in a travel lodge or inn in hindsight, but expectations were a lot higher than acheivements.Definitely no a four star in my opinion, but ok if you want close to the station or amenities, although there are several better within the same type of distance.Liked &#x2014 Leaving itDisliked &#x2014 Entering it',neg
'My partner and I live in Leeds and as the hotel is known to us and looks lovely from the outside we decided to combine a stay there with a trip to the theatre.The hotel upon arrival is very nice and modern and the staff on check in were polite and friendly.We asked for a smoking room which was on the 6th floor. The rooms are very small, albeit clean and tidy but certainly not to the standard as shown on the website. Apparently the contemporary rooms are extra. There were no ashtrays in a smoking room, which is odd.Breakfast was a nightmare. there were alot of free tables but none cleared so you had to sit in the reception and were called in. There was only 1 person clearing tables and 1 serving teas and coffees. Milk was not brought with your drinks so when asked for some they simply took it form a table which had been left but not yet cleared, as they did with the cutlery....The hot food was biffet, although not a great choice, when it was there it was hot. The problem was they kept runnign out of food and it took 10 minutes to replace it and then it ran out again. Not surprising when they filled it only with 4 rashers of bacon. the dining room certainly needs more staff, as that really marred the stay.I certainly would not choose to stay there again.Liked &#x2014 the entrance to the hotel and bar areas have been nicely refurbishedDisliked &#x2014 the dining room and the size of the bedroomsTips/Secrets &#x2014 stay at another hotel',neg
'We have just returned after 10 nights at The Oberoi.We were looking forward to our stay having read the reviews and received recommendations from friends about this hotel.Sadly, our experience was very different to those described on this review forum. The suite was very nice, clean and well stocked (had to remind them on a few occasions to re stock certain things - but overall good). Internet connections not working in serveral of the areas, including the main reception. The breakfast selection was good, varied but we has to wait at least 20 minutes for things like toast, pancakes etc if ordered.The service (in terms of speed and efficiency) was patchy to say the least. It was not unusual to wait 15-30 minutes for food in the main dining room at least and then the same again for them to clear the table! The pool service was equally as bad with the only exception being a waiter called Sallem.....very good! The pagola bar/restaurent was very slow in terms of service with food sat around on tables long after the occupants had left. This attracted flies and when watching the staff, tables were not cleaned down afterwards in preparation for next diners - just simply relayed.To add insuly to injury with the sketchy standards and service, 4 days in to our 10 night stay, we came down with serious stomach upsets that required drips, injections and drugs from the doctor. Over the next 6 days we were both very, very ill together with, to our knowledge, 6 other guests all requiring the doctor. I can only assume this was down to poor standards of cleanliness around the hotel and food preparation ares. This must have been an isolated incident though as the hotel has a very good reputation?? Perhaps standards temporarily sliped, new staff, short staffed, poor, slow service...who knows but, we would never, ever return (unless of course you require a severe wait loss programme)!!!',neg
'Building. This is one of those hotels designed by architects to impress, not to make guests feel comfortable. Depending on the section you stay in, you may have long walks inside to your room. The exterior is a feast of polished marble and sandstone on many levels with unlit hazards. There is very little green for such a huge area.Service. The staff are plentiful, but poorly trained. Their presence is intrusive but ineffective. We found it impossible to walk in the grounds without being followed and being asked repeatedly if there was anything you needed. We only ate breakfast in the hotel. The selection was far inferior to that offered in other hotels we stayed in for a similar price in India and indeed that offered in far less expensive hotels service largely ineffectual. A half hour wait for a poached egg could be a world record. Meanwhile there were no shortage of people trying to sell the spa - even intruding on your breakfast in their attempt.Our room was large with everything you could need, but much you could live more comfortably without. The clutter of klitch was oppressive. This is not real luxury but a pastiche put on by people who appear not to understand, or care, what travellers need.Room Tip: Get a room in the same block as reception and the restaurant if you want to avoid an interminable wa...See more room tips',neg

'We thought that we had saved money by staying at this hotel but infact as soon as we arrived we had to pay £20 to park the car. I checked the website and didnt find this anywhere and would never have booked the hotel if I had known this. On our second night of stay we heard a van park outside at 2 in the morning and made banging and crashing sounds as it was loading and unloading. I thought that it sounded like curtain poles being thrown around the place. I didnt know what it was so when the receptionist asked me how my stay was I told her about the curtain pole noises. She assured me that this was nothing to do with the hotel. When my parter and I walked outside the whole builing was covered in scafolding, magically overnight. I couldnt believe this! She lied to us outright - I wouldnt have minded so much if I had been given an explanation and an apology. We left the hotel needing another break as we were so exhausted.The rooms are standard, the staff unfriendly. 4 star - what a joke!',neg
'The entrance to the hotel was modern and spacious. The staff on check in were polite though appeared to be slightly unsure of what they were doing. They gave my wife and I a room on the fifth floor which I wouldn\'t have allowed my dog to stay in. When I asked for another room they said I had booked a standard double and would have to pay an upgrade of £20 pounds a night for a better room. I decided to pay the upgrade for the sake of convenience and we were placed on the third floor in a refurbished room which was tidy, modern but very very small. The standard of these rooms would not be what you would expect from a 4 star.The breakfast was fine and service was good but I would not recommend this hotel and I for one will never use it again.',neg

'I have stayed in lots of 4 and 5 star hotels and believe me, this is the WORST place ever - it\'s like Fawlty Towers but without the humour!!!!Had a weekend in Leeds for my wife\'s birthday and this place and the jokers that run it spoiled the whole occasion.1 - Its very tatty and run down, despite the rather glitzy reception!2 - I booked a large room, apparently one of the refurbished ones, but it felt dirty!3 - Outside the room next door was a room service tray with food leftovers on it, first spotted at 3pm it was still there at 8pm and stinking!!!4 - The bathroom smelled of sewage/drains etc - I told the reception team about it and they said there was a plumbing problem - I had to run the extractor all night to keep the smell down. In the morning the Duty Manager came to the room to have a sniff as the extractor had been on the smell had all but gone so she virtually called me a liar!5 - In the morning I called room service for a pot of tea (I don\'t like those cartons of milk they leave in the room) - when the guy arrived with the tea he gave me a load of those cartons!?!? I asked for a jug of milk and was told I couldn\'t have one because all the jugs were being used for breakfast (at 7.30 on a Sunday morning???) Eventually after ranting down the phone at someone a jug of milk arrived!!!When I book a weekend away I don\'t expect this kind of hassle or stress - to be told by the Duty Manager that I was blowing things out of proportion was just another insult!!I will never return to this dreadful place and urge anyone who reads this to take my advice and avoid like the plague.

'It would sum it up to say that I felt like crying when I saw the room. The reception and whole first floor is beautiful and the location is fab. But the rooms are apallingly shabby and grotty and on the night we stayed, despite it being cold outside, the room was too hot to sleep in. Opening windows made no difference to the heat and only let in the noise from the party downstairs. I had a really bad night\'s sleep and the bed groaned and creaked with every move. The staff are nice and quickly accommodated us when we asked to be given a different room, upon finding that the first one we were given had an unmade bed and a glass of wine in the bathroom. For the money, you could do a lot better. I wanted style and history. I didn\'t want the small and horrible room that we got. The photos on the website are hilarious. They might have one bedroom like the one shown. The two I saw were nothing like it. The breakfast is great if you are willing to pay the £15 being asked for it. The Met have some nerve to charge the prices they do. I didn\'t believe the reviews but you really have to see the rooms to believe how poor they are. I really wish I had booked somewhere else for my romantic weekend. A Holiday Inn or Travel Lodge would have been better.Liked &#x2014 breakfast and the gorgeous sous le nez restaurant nearbyDisliked &#x2014 the dirty glass in the bathroom',neg
'We were booked to stay at the Taj but due to change of ownwership had to choose Shalimar as recommended by the agent.The hotel was far from the town and although the entrance and the gardens were beautiful, we were disappointed with our room which was called an elegant room although we were booked for a cottage. The hotel was full so we had no choice.The room did not match the beautiful gardens of the hotel and we found it rather plain and with poor fittings. The blinds could not be closed completely with gaps at the edges, the hot water was inadequate, and the towels etc were of low quality.The restaurant was also not posh enough with poor service for the prices we were paying. The buffet price was exorbitant and the food did not match the price. There was insufficient Kerala cuisine.Overall it was one of the worst hotels we stayed in Kerala',neg

'Just returned from an overnight in Leeds. This is a lovely building, with a welcoming reception. Pity the receptionist wasnt. Despite being refurb\'d, they didnt bother stripping old paint off sash windows etc, or generally doing a quality job. Room was tiny and damp, with cheap ugly furniture. Old tv, terrible bathroom with cracked tiles,moldy grouting and a grotty, leaking shower, topped off with a smell of bad drains. We stayed with 4 other friends, and our room was the best !!!!. It was incredibly noisy, from outside, and more so from all rooms around with creaking, badly insulated floors. To top it all off, the breakfast was freezing cold...on colder plates....Wish we had left and gone to the Malmaison........',neg
'My friend and I stayed in the hotel before Christmas as the location was easy for the station and it looked pretty nice in the photos online. And on arrival our initial impression was quite good, the lobby is pretty smart. But our room was a disappointment. Really old-fashioned, with run down tired fittings and facilities, clearly hadn\'t been renovated or updated for about 20 years.On other trips to Leeds I have stayed at the Park Plaza and Mint hotel which are similar in price but both far superior with much more modern interiors.',neg
'I am very much a seasoned traveller &amp I can honestly say this was one of my worst experiences at a 4* hotel.- The hotel is in the middle of a renovation (the entire hotel is covered with mesh &amp scaffolding covering what looked like every window) No renovation was mentioned on my confirmation.- My bedroom was one of the older style rooms not only did the bed take up 90\% of the floor space, but the decor has 2* quality (room 603).- The only lift in the hotel was broken one evening. Climbing 5 flights of stairs is not the most enjoyable at the best of times.- I requested a wake up call, which never came, thus missing an important meeting.- Complete lack of communication between departments, my room was inclusive of dinner &amp I was presented with the bill!- General sloppy service &amp attitudeI would avoid staying at this hotel until the refurbishments has been completed &amp serious training for the staff.',neg
'Stayed for two nights with friends, good location and thats about the only good point.Our room was a disaster zone. The door handle came off in our hand everytime we opened the door, the lightswitch was faulty(no rocker switch to turn on/off(just a hole) last persons dirty socks behind the chair (obviously not cleaned) basin blocked and one of our threesome cut her foot open on the doorstop in the middle of the floor with a screw sticking out of the top. All these faults were reported and not fixed!! Handle and lightswitch could not be repaired, basin was still bunged up, temporary repair to doorstop and socks stayed there for duration of stay. The receptionist stated we should not have been allocated that room (due to electrical fault) and offered us a bottle of house wine, but did not reallocate our room (presumably due to being full) . Other members of our party were allocated attic rooms which were far worse than ours, however, those that arrived the next night had far superior rooms to us..so all in all,,its pot luck if you get a decent room (or is it!!) Will not return, far better deals on the other hotel chains in the area.',neg
'I booked this without reading the Tripadvisor reviews (first mistake!) and then once i had heard about them i mulled over cancelling but it was just before my visit to this hotel so at the risk of not finding anywhere on a Friday and Saturday night i didnt cancel (2nd mistake).Hotel Location - Good - cant be faulted, although its car park isnt signposted so you will more than likely pass this on a busy one way street - not ideal to stop outside to unload either!Building (from the outside) - NiceStaff - Helpful...although the reception desk is too small for the size of the hotel and therefore understaffed as there is no room to put more than 2 people behind it , had to wait 20 minutes in a long queue to check outAnother reason i didnt cancel was due to being led to believe from its own website and others that a refurbishment of the rooms had taken place. The lobby certainly looked impressive, the literature of its other hotels also showed similar modern interiors and the picture I saw of a refurbished room of the Met looked impressive. Either bad luck or some mis-information somewhere along the lines resulted in my staying in a room which was at best a very bad seaside guest house. The room was not refurbished, decor was old and tired, the bed was very uncomfortable and the bathroom just didnt feel clean (bath had bad staining for example). There was also no mini bar (which is a first on me in a 4* hotel room to be honest)For what is billed as a modern - above average priced - central leeds hotel it seems to lack 3 of the 4 stars it claims to have in the room I had, Thankfully Leeds as a city is fab, will not stay or recommend this hotel again though - even when its finally fully refurbished!',neg
'I think we were lucky with our rooms - we weren\'t on the top floor and had nice modern decor rooms. Beds were lumpy. I was working until 3am the night I stayed over and both myself and my colleague booked to have the room an extra hour until 12pm the next day to sleep in (this cost £5 per room).My room was directly opposite the lift and I can honestly say that the noise from the lift is beyond acceptable. The volume of buzzers and alerts all of which seem totally unecessary is absolutely ridiculous! Every time someone used the lift on my floor it was like an alarm clock going off. Unfortunately I had another 14 hour day at work the next day on absolutely no sleep... this makes me so angry!Then at 11.30am the next morning, even though we had organised to have the rooms until 12pm a rude and abrupt lady called my colleague informing her that she should have left her room at 11am. When my colleague explained the situation she did not apologise and her manner did not change, she simply put down the phone.They waivered our £5 per room for the extra hour fee but I feel maybe it would have been an idea to refund some of the cost of the room I slept in. I was not able to use it for the purpose I required - a basic in a hotel... SLEEP! I\'m still furious!',neg
'The only thing this place has going for it is the location - beautiful beach and head straight out of the back of the hotel directly to the sand and sea. Other than that, avoid this place at all costs! What a terrible experience. Hotel staff can be called poorly trained (at best), incompetetant.Midnight, awoke to to the sound of hammering on the wall from construction workers...could not speak to a manager to resolve the problem for at least half an hour due to the receptionist being unwilling to connect my call as it was a complaint. Despite finally getting through to the duty manager, work continued for a further time, despite all assurances that it was stopped. During a working session we hosted in the one of the meeting rooms, the waiters chatted during the sessions, cleaned cups/bottles away noisliy and had to be repeatedly asked to be quiet to stop the disturbances.Whoever wrote the last review re: bed linen - totally agree!! Yuck - mine had marks on the linen that I dont even wish to describe.....Final straw, just how long does it take to make a coffee?? Three calls and one hour later to be exact. Frustratingly bad service at 5 star prices - never again',neg
'My wife and I stayed at the MET 11th February 2012. We entered the hotel to find a very modern quality Lobby. Upon checkin at the desk the staff member dealing with us smirked as he told us we were in room 605.When we arrived on the 6th floor there was a smell that you would expect to find in an old seaside bed and breakfast.The room was very outdated. In an old hotel such as this it can be expected that there would be some original features but this was too old. My wife immediately pointed out the mould and dead flies on the flase bathroom roof (photo supplied) The net curtains were very dirty and the window frames were in a state. (photo supplied)In an attempt to get on with it we stayed in the room. The heat in the room was unbearable the whole night. The heating in the room was not turned on but being in what appears to be the loft space its very hot. My wife did not sleep for most of the night, sitting in a chair next to the sash window that only opens 2 inches wide. The room expierience was the worst my wife and I have ever suffered and this room makes a mockery of the 4star hotel rating.In the morning we were eager to leave the room. We did enjoy a superb breakfast in the modern ground floor of the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpfull. The food was the best I have expierienced in a hotel. It is a huge shame that the rest of the expierience was so bad as I believe there are actually some nice rooms as the leaflets picture..Customers need to be warned prior to being allocated the substandard rooms in the loft.Room Tip: Not room 605See more room tips',neg
'We stop at various hotels around the country and in particualr Leeds for short leisure breaks and until having stayed at The Met Leeds have never been booked into a disabled room!! Due to tight schedule and busy reception (wedding in progress) we could not get chance to complain whilst at the Hotel. Immediately on return we contacted the Hotel &amp Parent Company direct to complain about being allocated a disabled room. We dont want to spend our hard earned cash to take a break in a hotel room which has full disabled facilities ( lowered mirrors, padded toilet back rest, padded disabled chair ( wall mounted in shower)etc!! We never recieved reply until having to contact them again 4 days later!!

Quite honestly i find this totally insulting and adding to the Humilation of having to stop a night in a room full of disabled equipment!!

'Stayed in this hotel for my hen weekend, we were so disappointed with the rooms allocated to our party. Most of the girls where on floor 5 and it looked like it belonged to a different hotel (1940\'s wallpaper peeling off the walls, stains on the carpet, dark and dismal) - when you walk in to entrance of hotel its very modern and contemporary. Some of the girls had a room on floor 4 and it looked exactly like it does on the website, really modern and worthy of the 4 star rating and price. We complained to the receptionist and she said we had bought a standard room not a contemporary one, but how come some of the party were allocted to the contemporary rooms? The room price was the same for all of us but we all received different standards of rooms. In the end I asked to speak to the manager and a few members of the party were given refurbished rooms but not all, which means half got a 2 star room for the same price as 4 star - not acceptable!!Floor 5 upwards should not be classed as 4 star and should be given out at a discounted rate. If staying at this hotel soon please ask for rooms that are on floor 4 and below.',neg

'BELOW IS A LETTER I\'LL BE EMAILING TO LEEDS MET MANAGEMENT.Dear Sir/Madam,I write to complain about what I thought was a very poor service and generally unsatisfactory stay at your hotel.I am shocked that you proclaim yourself an \'upper four star\' hotel and many (if not all) of my complaints stem from the fact that I would associate a four star standard with a impeccable presentation and upkeep.FYI I stayed in your hotel in room 504 on 11th May 2009. * The room was very small by the standards I would expect from four star. Poky would be the relevant word. * There was no minibar * As said by another person who has commented here: you do not make it clear and up-front that building work is taking place. This is noisy and people should be in full consciousness of this fact when deciding whether to give you their money. * Internet access was shockingly priced (£15.00 or so for 24hrs), this charge was not up front and clear (instead stated in a small window that appeared on the computer screen, which was not noticed by this particular punter) and I know of few 4 stars who consider that they should charge on top of their rates for the internet email. * The state of the furnishings in the room was poor. It doesn\'t appear that you\'ve bothered to replace or repair bedside or TV tables when they\'ve grown warn. Nor do you seem to replace your literature very often, as it was tatty and warn. * The state of the fittings in the room was poor. The shower door was not water tight or large enough, meaning that the bathroom floor got very wet in the natural course of a shower. The taps in the bathroom, aside from being rather unstylish and unsightly, more importantly did not work well and appeared to need new washers. * The bed was lumpy and not at all comfortable. * The room was noisy and night and had a constant humming emanating from around the bathroom area. * There was food left in the hallway for at least 3hours near to the lift, which was neither hygenic nor the level of service I would expect.Many of these criticisms I would not make for a budget hotel. You\'re prepared to work your way around flaws if you\'re accepting a bargain basement place. However, I think it\'s right to be particular if you\'re paying for a certain standard.However, I would not consider your hotel up to that standard and strongly advise other potential visitors to think twice before they stay at Leeds Met.Go for assured quality elsewhere, say I.Yours faithfully,Ben Walford',neg
'Ok, it\'s my own fault, I\'m always leaving booking hotels to the last minute and my hotel of preference was fully booked again. We can get you in the Met said the agent. Oh no I thought.I\'ve stayed in the hotel 3 or 4 times now and I\'m yet to be thrilled by the hotel in any way whatsoever. The comments I\'ve read on here regarding the state of the rooms reassured me that the reception hadn\'t taken a personal dislike to me. Last night I was up in the eaves on the 6th floor (the lift only goes to the 5th floor).£15 for 24 hours of intenet access or 50 pence per minute (the connection is actually very good) is not what I\'d call VFM. I can\'t remember the last 2* hotel I was in that only had the 5 terrestrial tv channels available.I\'ve never bothered with breakfast as to be honest I just want to get out of the hotel as quick as I can in the morning.Hopefully one of these days I\'ll learn my lesson and get my bookings sorted out well in advance so I don\'t have to dread my evenings in Met again.Liked &#x2014 DepartureDisliked &#x2014 Arrival',neg
'I haven\'t even stayed in the hotel yet and am hoping it\'s better than the \'warm\' welcome I received when I phoned up earlier . We\'re off to a wedding at 2pm and I asked if it would be possible for them to let us in our room an hour earlier so we could get ready. The receptionist was most unhelpful and didn\'t seem to know what the procedure was. Eventually he said it\'s not possible.He asked me to \'stop raising my voice\' for no apparent reason and then when I asked his name he snapped back \'what\'s yours?\' Charming first impression. I then asked to speak to the manager and he said \'She\'s on holiday\' when I asked to speak to the next in command he put me on hold for 10 minutes. In the end I rang off and have been trying for at least an hour to get through to reception but surprise,surprise, no one is answering. The phone is just ringing and ringing. If this is an example of the quality of service, I can\'t wait to see the room we\'re given! No one seems to know what customer service means anymore - everything is so cut and dried. I\'m surprised he didn\'t utter the immortal line \'computer says no.\'',neg
'Room 605 was an affront to the Hotel * rating system and at £117.00 per night was an absolute disgrace. Room shabby and absolutely stifling with bed shoved against wall.Management excuses for this room were pathetic - \'booked at short notice\', \'booked through a booking agency on the internet\', \'Room 605 is a traditional room\' , \'it is an old building\'Not sure what a traditional room actually means - but beware traveller ! Foolishly I thought I was booking accommodation as described on their web site, silly me !The rivers will run dry before I step inside that place again !!!',neg
'There is nothing charming about the airless cottages. As the cottage was situated near an excuse for a stream, the windows had to remain shut in the evening against the marauding mosquitoes. No aircon to circulate the air but a tiny tangential fan. After an abysmal lunch where we left the food uneaten, we were loathe to have dinner there too and couldn\'t wait to check out early before breakfast.Room Tip: A room on the hill away from the smelly stream may be a better option.See more room tips',neg
'This hotel is well positioned in the middle of Birmingham and only a few minutes from the station. However that\'s the only positive thing I can say about my stay!Lift broken on arrival and room on the fourth floor! The room was very shabbywith old furniture, water marked chair, mouldy bathroom tiles and a shattered door frame. The room wasnot even very clean.Far from 4*.The communal areas looked tired but a bar snack was fine. Brakfast was good with the exception of a plant on the table which had plainly been dead for weeks!A conversation with the duty manager about all these issues was not productive.I hope I don\'t have to attend anymore conferences here.',neg
'I did not stay at this hotel as I found the management of this hotel to be a bunch of inhumane greedy lot. My family and I were going to Ahmadabad for pilgrimage and we wanted to just overnight at this hotel. On speaking to 2 different reservation staff, we were given a so called amazing rate of INR 8,000 for 4 people in one suite, incl tax, b/f. We had explained our situation: we were going to check-in at around 10-11pm after the first pilgrimage, overnight in the hotel and leave at 5-6am. What would be the b/f? Muffins and coffee!Could we switch to dinner as we would be hungry at that late time.NO!Asked if we could be dropped off to the pilgrimage area on forward airport transfer which was in town anyway. We would return to the hotel ourselves just take our baggage to make it easier.NO!I cancelled my reservation.Latter on in the night, I tried again, hoping to find a more humane person. I found someone (name withheld) who really understood but he had to get approval from his Manager and would call back. In 1 hour, he called back to say apologetically that his Manager said no b/f or airport transfer request.My point: Expedia rate is INR 8006 incl with b/f as above for 2 twin rooms. I dont know what favor they were doing for us? The Management should really be trained in hospitality. Maybe get in young educated and smart people? (I stayed at a 4.5* hotel in Cochin which had young staff out of hospitality courses, and they were amazing and up to par with international standards) What would you lose to be a bit more of a human being, considering I was going to pay full fare anyway for a 6 hours stay. I was not asking to stay for free. Finally, I would not spend my dollar at this place. What goes around does surely come around being a stranger in a new place is difficult enough, my outlook of other parts of India was slightly tainted.',neg
'The Met hotel in Leeds, supposed to be a 4*hotel but personally wouldn\'t give it a 2* rating.The hotel is advertised as unique and contemporary having been recently refurbished and they pride themselves on the attention to detail. The rooms were dirty and the bathroom didn\'t look like it had been cleaned for a very long time, had to request house keeping to clean it before even considering to use it.If you want a 4* hotel based on location alone then this is the hotel for you, being fab for the convenience of Leeds city centre. Cleanliness however is certainly lacking in this hotelLiked &#x2014 LocationDisliked &#x2014 Cleanliness',neg
'On arriving at this hotel I was booked into a single room on the top floor. This is an old hotel and on arriving in the room found it to be very tired looking although the bathroom did look like it had been recently re-vamped. I then sat on the bed. It was the noisiest bed I have ever sat on. The slightest movement made a noise. I went to reception and spoke to a lovely helpful receptionist called Kat who said that there were no more rooms. I was not moving wihout a result as there was no way I would have slept at all and it was another room or another hotel. She then swapped me with another guest who had yet to arrive - I m sorry whoever you were...The rooms had sash windows and didn\'t close properly and so it was noisy from outside. There were mould marks on the pillowslip which I handed into reception when I checked out the following day.The bathmat was threadbare with 2 holes in it. The lift was broken, the floors sqeak, the sink in the bathroom was a cloakrrom size sink not that of a 4* hotel, there was dust on the doors, skirting, corners of bathroom. I couldn\'t wait to leave and go and have a good wash!!!Never again!Liked &#x2014 The staffDisliked &#x2014 cleanliness and standard for a 4star hotel',neg
'We were booked in at this hotel for business, and first impressions were good. It seemed clean and the room was fairly large. Then it went down hill. The room was hot and there was no air-con or fan available in the room. Opening the window was only really an option while awake due to the noise from the street outside. Through the night I think I managed a couple of hours sleep, but the matresses were far too soft and the nosie from the street, the floor above and outside the door kept me awake most of the night.Morning finally came around, and I was pleased I could just get up and out. I went for a shower only to receive a shock from the cold water that came out. Even when set to the hottest setting, I could only just bare to stand underneath.Parking is very limited, though being city centre, that should be expected, and be prepared to pay £10 per 24 hours to do so. Internet is charged at 50p per minute, a complete rip-off and of the 9 availalbe free TV stations, only 1-4 worked.I would by no means recommend this to anyone.',neg
'The heading says it all, watch your valuables!, actually I\'m referring to the Spa at the hotel. I had a massage there and they asked me to place my necklace into a jewellery box. Now I never take that necklace off, except when I have a massage, so as far as I\'m concerned I put it in their care. Needless to say I didn\'t get it back, and no amount of complaining afterwards gave any sort of apology or compensation. They said that this was an isolated incident, but I wonder, maybe you know better .....',neg
'Though the hotel is a decent structure but software needs too much of of training. Senior staff is just not bothered about the services and having ball of a time. I had to pay for something which I did not even use because the Front Office Incharge was behaving like a goon for Rs. 160/- only. In food and Beverage you rarely get what you order, the only way to get what you want is that you have to speak to Chef only.Whether Food or Beverage you never get the same at appropriate temperature. Housekeeping cleans the rooms as per their convenience only.The only staff to praise for is the front line staff of Front Office who go out of the way to help you.Overall I would say, that stay there only if you dont have any other option.',neg
'I had stayed on this hotel a number of years ago while on a training trip to Leeds and was looking forward to seeing it after it\'s £6million renovations.I found the hotel on laterooms and as I wanted to pay for my booking in advance I called the reservations line direct. Once I gave my details they tried to connect me to reception to pay. They were busy but I was told someone would call the next morning to confirm. I received no call so emailed to follow up, still nothing by late afternoon so called and finally was able to pay. I was promised confirmation by email but never received it at all before we checked in. It would have been courtesy to send a quick email, I personally thought this was poor.Once we checked in we decided to have some drinks in the bar. We were told the restaurant was closed (with no explanation, also would have been good to be told this in a confirmation email). A total waste of time. After waiting 10 minutes for someone to arrive to serve us I had to go to reception to get someone to the bar. When he eventually arrived he offered us a special which was a bottle of Rose, after dissapearing for another 10 minutes he returned to say they had none left. He gave quite a rambling and confusing explanation when offering other drinks. Once we chose something else he dissapeared again. A customers came and went, so did he until he returned only to set off the fire alarm and evacuate the hotel. Once back in we finishe our drinks and left. I have drank and dined in Tempus (the bar/restaurants in the PH hotels) in Edinburgh several times and the service is second to none, this hotel could learn a thing or two.As for the rooms, we must have had the smallest one in the hotel. Nothing like the basic double we were advertised and had paid for on their website. The bathroom was not as described as it was on their site and was obviously missed in their multi million pound make over. Like other reviewers we were woken at all hours by bottles being collected and couldn\'t open the windows much due to this or the massive pigeon flock outside the window.For some reason the room was so warm, with no air conditioning and only a small desk top fan it was impossible to sleep.Overall I was very disappointed with the hotel. Leeds is a fantastic city with a lot to offer and after really looking forward to our break, it has really put my boyfriend and myself off coming back.',neg
'i was booked into this hotel by work, from the outside it is an attractive old style hotel i was quite optimistic, but even though i had booked a double room i was put in a single room instead. i called reception and they said that they were really busy due to a convention and all they had left available was a room with a queen size bed, which i reluctantly agreed to accept.thedecor standards of the room itself was poor. it was actually quite shabby, dirty and torn window nets, messy paintwork, peeling wallpaper, very messily patched plasterwork both in the room and in the bathroomalthough not a double, the bed was comfortable, however i found sleep very difficult due to both the noise from outside during the night, and what seemed to be a constantly running water cistern situated over the closet space in my roomthe closet space (built in wardrobe) was spacious and contained an ironing board and iron and also a fan. As the room was hot and stuffy, the fan came in useful in the evening, but was too noisy to leave on overnight',neg

'Here is my experience of a what is supposedly a world class hotel. I was trying to book a banquet hall for my group\'s (~150) party in Vizag. Tried several times to call the reservations desk using the number on their website. Its not reachable ! Upon emailing the manager, I get a response saying  Show up in person and we will help you  !!! Futher , the email says its because of the bad BSNL tel lines .. well then , FIX IT !Even my neighbourhood Garden Inn is accessible at 3 am in the night. A world class hotel can\'t ask its guest to show up onsite for a reservation request . Having had the privilage of travelling to various parts of the world and staying at numerous properties, this has easily been my worst experience. This property may have good facilities and service levels for guest but if its not reachable by phone, especially for customers that live half way around the globe, then it is an absolute shame !Its been 3 days since I started trying to get in touch with them, they haven\'t even replied to my email asking for traiff\'s and menu\'s for banquet facilites. The other properties that I got in touch at the same time, have sent me what I was looking for ( and surpise, their ph\'s work day and night despite being &lt 1 km away from Novotel!!) .. no prizes for guessing where I am going next!!!PS - I haven\'t stayed at or visited this property yet , so not going to give a negative rep for the facilities etc... only pissed at their serivce( of lack of it)',neg
'The Met Hotel was in an excellent location in the city centre, however my friends and I were quite appalled with the room decor and cleanliness (or should i say lack of). The divan beds had chunks missing from the corners, the side of the bath was hanging off, there was cracks up the walls and the carpet was stained. We complained about one window as it would not shut properly which kept two people awake due to the wind, however the reception staff did nothing about it. Two out of five of us actually came home with insect bite marks! I was very surpised to see a 4* hotel room in this state and I will definitely give this hotel a miss next time I visit LeedsLiked &#x2014 LocationDisliked &#x2014 The room',neg
'The reviews on this website compound my own thoughts and experiences perfectly.I originally stayed in this hotel in August 2005 whilst working on an event for Nokia at the Leeds Festival. The PR agency booked us into the hotel and I was relatively impressed by the decor. When we arrived at the hotel we were given our information packs left by the PR agency which contained information on the event we were working on. I asked the hotel staff at this stage whether we needed to check in or we could do this later. They actively encouraged us to check in later. So imagine my surprise when I turned up later, albeit at 2am, to find out they\'d cancelled our rooms because we\'d not checked in! Despite the rooms being blocked booked by the PR agency. We were a party totalling about 40 rooms that weekend. Eventually the night staff were able to check us into two separate rooms which were one of the newly refurbed contemporary rooms. Whilst these were clean and modern in terms of decor the old window frames and poor lighting made them feel rather gloomy. However the rest of my stay there was okay.I decided to return there in September 2006 with my fianceé, her brother and his girlfriend. We booked the rooms in Nov 2005 as we were going to the Robbie Williams concert and knew hotel rooms were going to be limited in Leeds city centre. We had planned a relaxed afternoon in Leeds before heading to Roundhay park. Imagine our extreme surprise and disappointment when we received a call to say we\'d been outbooked to Jury\'s Inn hotel due to overbooking at the hotel! Firstly we\'d booked more than 10 months in advance of the date, secondly to get a call an hour before our arrival time, and thirdly the Jury\'s Inn hotel was supposedly a 3* hotel and we\'d booked an apparently 4* hotel. When we arrived at the Jury\'s Inn hotel we discovered no on-site parking with a 10 minute walk from the nearest NCP/Q-Park multi-storey. On check in the hotel was packed with many people having been outbooked from The Met. Not only had communication broken down between The Met and Jury\'s Inn - they only had records of one room being transfered. Eventually this was sorted out but it took more than half a dozen phone calls and over an hour. Our afternoon was ruined but we still had a good evening to look forward to. When we returned from the concert the hotel looked like a bomb had hit it. The bar was heaving with very little staff on duty. We were woken up more than 3 times during the night by drunken guests shouting and running up and down the corridorsCheck out was reasonably easy but it totally marred the whole weekend. I complained to The Met and received a reply offering a complimentary weekend for four including dinner, bed and breakfast.We arrived at the hotel on Sat 3rd March with anticipation. Within 2 minutes of arrival we were shown the poor level of service this hotel provides its guests. Firstly police were on the scene due to a vehicle having been broken into - therefore reassuring us of the safety of a private car park. Next on check in, the receptionist could not find both bookings despite being given the reference numbers and a copy of the letter sent to me. Eventually the rooms were allocated and whilst I got a very large room, the other couple were given a boxier sized room. The rooms were decorated in a modern design but the facilities were limited (no mini-bar, standard tv and tea &amp coffee sachets which I\'d expect in a travelodge or holiday inn). We were given dinner on the house and apart from some earlier guests we were the only ones in the restaurant. The menu was extremely limited but the service was excellent and food well presented. It\'s a shame there wasn\'t more atmosphere. But with a limited menu I guess they aren\'t going to make it a destination restaurant.Front of house were friendly and helpful and the hotel felt calm and organised. However it was a different matter when it came to sleeping and breakfast.There was no sound insulation between the rooms and especially between room ceilings and floors above. We could hear everything from the room above which considering the occupants - 20 yr old blokes who\'d been out partying - was not pleasant.The room was unbearable hot due to no air conditioning and the windows were not double glazed.Breakfast was reasonably good but the serving staff did not explain the menu and provided coffee and tea pots with no lids. Overall I would not go back to the hotel which is disappointing considering the amount of money spent on the refurbishment.I actually had a more relaxing stay at the Express by Holiday Inn near the Armouries in late Jan than last night.They need to pull their socks up to achieve what they market themselves as.Liked &#x2014 The location and potentialDisliked &#x2014 The failure to deliver on a promise',neg
'This hotel stay was a major disappointment and I would not stay here again. The restaurant does not open during August - apparently not enough guests stay to warrant the cost....not surprised. My room was very noisy _ i got bout two hours sleep. The main problem was the bars dumping their glass bottels from 11pm to 5am. There in no air conditioning so the rooms are very warm indeed but you cant open the windows because of the noise. When the bottle dumping stops its then the turn of the pigeons outside the window to weave their magical sounds.Breakfast was a major disappointment.....not enough staff, just one on duty and one borrowed from reception, until someone came in at 7:50 but was late.So all in all a very poor experience - at least reception disk apologise at checkout - but it would have been better if they had really meant it rather than the cursory \'sorry about that\'.The bathroom was not that clean and the rooms definitely need to be freshened up.I will not be back.Room Tip: Ask for a room that faces the main road rather than the bars.See more room tips',neg
'i stayed in the met hotel for 3 days due to a conference i was attending..and after looing at the reviews thought i had best get a deluxe contempary double, which was extremely dissapointing...i think the hotel should take a realistic look at what other hotels chains are offering to bring them to speed of what is expected of a 4 star hotel! my t.v was old and tiny, no fridge, no mini bar, no selection of t.v channels, housekeeping woke me up despite having do not disturb on the door..even if they hadnt opened the door, i still heard them shout \'housekeeping\'to the other guests at 9 in the morning! in all my experiences, in many hotels, this is a very dissapointing one. I have to ask the question why is it luxurious? whats modern about it and whats contempary?....even ibis have flat screen in their rooms now and thats a 2 star!! and dont get me started on the staff or the prices for drinks at the (tiny) bar ...we tried to get \'flaming sambukka\' that would not light..i wonder why (surely not watered down)!! the beer was flat and 2 small glasses of house wine was over £12 ..shocking since it was corked.Liked &#x2014 leaving',neg
'Well, i dont really know what they boast off, fine the ambiance is nice but then the food sucks. I came to know that the pool side bar is only open for people staying in the hotel, if that is the case then they need to publicize this on there website, privacy... if that is the case please publicize it because the guests can feel a bit embarrassed when the staff rudely denies u entry for no fault of urz as u never knew about it.The drinks in the bar is served with Kurkure and Channas... now how pathetic can that be in the 5 star, common, i was seriously shocked when i saw all this, i was paying for an overtly high priced so called 5 star food, but then the star rating doesnt always come with the beautiful architecture but with the service as well.The veg platter i then ordered with the drinks were equally disgusting, i am only rating this hotel 2 because of its aesthetic looks, otherwise when u talk about 5-7 stars, this should be just 1.',neg

'Good location for station and city centre, which is why we booked. Room spacious, but bed and chairs not very comfortable. Antiquated TV without teletext - I am extremely hard of hearing and dependent on subtitles. Adolescent duty manager had no idea what to do about this. Bathroom looked good until I turned the shower on and discovered the miserably inadequate water pressure. We arrived late evening and ordered a bar meal - kitchen staff clearly unfamiliar with croque monsieur, which lacked the top layer of cheese always provided in France. Breakfast quality seems to depend on timing: on our first morning, when we came down towards the end of breakfast, the hot buffet had clearly been left unattended far too long, as everything was lukewarm. Most items were overcooked, but the sausages (by way of variety?) seriously undercooked. It was better on the other mornings, when we were in the middle of the breakfast period.',neg
'When we arrived at the hotel, check in was fine - even though I had requested a twin room, I was told that there was no twin rooms left as the hotel was full and we thought what have people been complaining about on Trip Advisor.... well on our first night we found out... there was a party (it was the season for parties, so I did expect some noise....) we were on the second floor above the party - the floor was vibrating with the noise and you could hear every sound - this lasted until 1am!We went down for breakfast the next day, it was fine had to wait for a table - breakfast was edible but not the same quality as I had stayed in other Principal Hayley hotels - breakfast the second day we had to stand for 10mins before even been noticed that we were waiting for a table. On our second night stay we had to be evacuated a couple of times from the hotel due to faults on the fire alarm system - we did not get an apology from the hotel - when I have stayed in other hotels when they have had a fault they have said we are sorry and what had happened - nothing here!When we checked out the staff did not seem to care about anything - did not even thank you for your stay or any inconvience due to the party / fire alarm! When I checked out I was told that there was nothing to pay, yet when I have receied my credit card statement, there has been a charge put on my statement - yet I did not leave my credit card details with the check in staff as I said I would pay as I go - the only time that the hotel had my details was when I paid for the hotel back in September - I cant believe that they have kept hold of my details - nor was I informed of this!I would definately not stay in this hotel again - even after it was recommended by some friends!',neg
'Full of older families corralled into a compound, unable to leave, forced to purchase average food at Michelin star prices, this hotel takes the form of a retirement village of villas splayed across a tract of seaside desert. The rooms are entirely substandard, poor old fashioned CRT-type televisions, bathrooms with more filler-cement than tile, old furniture and a long walk to the pool. Unless you call for a golf cart which you won\'t do for fear of looking lazy. Don\'t try and leave the hotel - they won\'t call you a taxi, and the car they lay on is priced and the precise level to make leaving for a cheap bite in town, not monetarily worthwhile. The breakfast buffet which is normally inclusive is of poor quality, with those fruit juice thimbles instead of glasses to prevent you from drinking too much of their precious orange juice. I lived in Egypt for a long time, and this is the very worst of it.',neg

'Was on a business visit with a colleague. Did a reservation 15 days earlier on a twin sharing basis. To the shock of my life - they asked us to share the bed as all the other rooms with two separate rooms were blocked. Did\'nt inform us at the time of booking nor one day earlier when we checked the status of the booking. The management was very high handed in the approach and were using bullying tactics. On top of it we had next day a co press conf and a launch event - which they were trying to cancel and block it when we raised the issue. Finally it was most customer unfriendly experience I ever had in my life from an industry which is known as hospitality industry. The general manager was brash, arrogant, devoid of any mannerism or ettiquetes and trying to be a bully. But I was able to take him on the face and put him in place but still it\'s a terrible terrible experience to share with all of you',neg

At checkout they tried to charge us twice and the food is awful.I asked for a plain omlette at breakfast and was given a full on Masala omlette with chilli and green coriander - no excuses from them I was the only person in the restaurant !!

'Hotel seemed fine and everything, but they didn\'t have a room for me! Unbelievably had booked me in a hotel in Wakefield, and gave me taxi chits to get in and out of Leeds with. I think it probably worked out for the best as the hotel seemed pretty noisy with drunk people on a Saturday night but nonetheless getting in a taxi was the last thing I wanted to do after getting off the last train from London. When I did get to the hotel in Wakefield they didn\'t know anything about me but we couldn\'t get through to the Met reception until morning so service was pretty useless all round.If they had called me before to let me know of the problem I could have got off the train at Wakefield and saved a whole load of time.

'We recently stayed at The Met Hotel in Leeds having pre booked 2 months beforehand. We booked 3 doubles and one single. Hotel is a joke - very limited parking space, not told to us until we got there after a seven hour drive to Leeds to find car park full. Were given awful rooms on top floor and insisted that we were moved - eventually given slightly better rooms (had to lug all our luggage ourselves as no porter) However beds were lumpy - hair dryers didnt work - no towels in bathrooms - so hot in the rooms had to have fan on all night - charged a fortune for internet use (refunded after we complained) - awful breakfast - eggs undercooked and dirty tables - total confusion at breakfast between the staff - key cards constantly not working - housekeeping was a joke - beds barely made up - nothing else touched. This is not a four star hotel - the only thing that redeemed was the effort of the floor staff but they were fighting a losing battle. Duty manager on check out seemed distinctly disinterested and seemed to have heard it all before.',neg
'Hi Friends,I stayed in Hotel Unmed last year during one of my business trip. I was there for 2 nights. First of all its location is weird. It is very near to airport and far from city. For everything you are dependent on car/something.Services are pathetic. Interestingly staff does not bother also if you complain or request for anything. Food is also tasteless.. Anyway somehow not a good hotel to stay. Its overpriced also. Not worth it. I heard its a taj property. I am surprised how come Taj folks can have a tie-up with these people.',neg
'I recently returned from a lengthy stay in India and it saddens me to write that although a beautiful property, Shalimar Spice Garden offered the worst service of any hotel I have ever been to. The staff was not trained in any way whatsoever. Although 90\% of the guests spoke English, few of the staff did. Getting something as simple to drink as a cup of tea often ended in a 45 minute wait. The pool, though lovely, had too few chairs, so that it was usually not possible to sit by it. The staff would routinely enter the room despite a do not disturb sign on the door. The spa service was anything but relaxing. One of our party was ushered into a linen closet for her treatment. The restaurant was wildly inconsistent, but owing to service that was beyond incompetent, most of my groups meals ended in frustration. I would never stay there again, and I advise anyone to avoid this place like the plague. It was amateurish in almost every facet.Liked &#x2014 locationDisliked &#x2014 Service',neg
'I stayed at the Met for a conference. The entrance lobby is dark, and Cold. My room was tired, and I wasn\'t able to sleep because of the road noise and the noise of the loading dock below the room. The linen was old and and stained. The towels were also thin. The staff are very pleasant and try hard. The conference dinner was conference average with the predictable chicken dish. Good coffee and snacks. Nice breakfast in a pleasant room.For those planning a conference, don\'t come here. The conference room is very noisy from the road, chairs uncomfortable, and the room is not nice.The hotel has been equipped with Eco-type lamps which give an unpleasant light which I found difficult to read the presentationsBut it is a hotel, and if you can\'t sleep, it is pointlessRoom Tip: If you do stay, get a room high up a the back of the hotelSee more room tips',neg

'Stayed at the hotel for a national conference. The hotel is centrally located with interesting art deco architecture. All staff were very helpful and helped us get our first room changed as it looked directly into the fire escape and smelt of fried food,The quality of the food did not reflect a 4 star hotel. No brown bread or butter available on the Friday breakfast, whilst the white was incredibly thin and not porridge option. The room was basic and clean, but I decided not to use the very expensive internet connection. If I were visiting Leeds I would investigate other hotels before staying at his hotel again. PS parking is an issue as limited availability so we used a website called \'Park at my house\' for local parking.',neg
'Stayed at The Met Sat 2nd September for 1 night - paid £70.Reception area etc was very modern and thought wow this looks like a nice place to stay. We had a double room on 5th Floor. Entered lift with another customer who was staying on 4th Floor - doors opened on 4th floor - very modern. Then we got to 5th floor - absolutly HORRIBLE! It acyually looked like we were in a different hotel!!!!! It looked like we had opened onto a 1 or 2* B&ampB that you would expect to pay £20 a night for. On entering our room the smell of stale smoke overwhelmed us ( we didn\'t want a smoking room and we also requested a non-smoking room). The room was dirty, dated and was in desperate need of a refurb.The bathoom had a shower over the bath. The tiles had lots of mould gowing on them and also the shower itseld had seen better days.The linen on the bed also smelt of stale smoke. Oh and to top all this off someone had very nicely put a bogey on the wallpaper next to the bed.Complained to reception - sorry we\'re full and can\'t move youI\'m not normally the kind of person to complain - but this room has got to be the worse place i have ever stayed in. One word - AVOID :-)',neg

'We felt the hotel was very overpriced. You\'re definitely paying a premium for the location. Room was clean, but very small (3m x 3m) with uninspiring decor and and showing signs of wear and tear in places. Overall a real lack of attention to detail.Be warned that they also do Hen/Stag packages for £25 a head so it could be noisy late at night although it was ok when we stayed on a Friday night.Parking is £10 a day but phone and ensure they reserve a place when you book. Although we did they still hadn\'t reserved us a space and there are only 20-odd spaces.At breakfast there was reasonable service but little variety - the single bowl of natural yoghurt was very sour. Pastries were old, orange juice tasted watery and reconstituted. Cooked breakfast was acceptable.In our opinion, it would be much better value to book a Travelodge or Holiday Inn Express - the experience is comparable to those type of hotel and they are half the price of The Met. Money saved could be used for the taxi fare into city centre that staying elsewhere might require.Room Tip: It&#39s in a very built up city area so you&#39re unlikely to get a good view, ask for a room that...See more room tips',neg

In all i had very bad experience of hospitality. The staff was un-cooperative to the point of being hostile sometimes.Only the views were good.More over we were overcharged by cleartrip. the rates displayed at hotel were below what cleartrip charged us.',neg
'Got one of the better rooms, superior with a full view of the Sea. The room was ok, not very large . The view of the waterwas nice. Very expensive for what we got though.The rooms were not insulated for sound at all. We could not get sleep at all because we could hear everything from the other rooms, even doors opening and shutting, TV\'s, people talking even a little loud. I was terrible.Went to the restaurant to eat the live Barbecue, very average. The view was nice but there is an active port right accross from it, so you see huge cranes and hear various industrial noises Overall this hotel is very average and pretends to be a luxury hotel, which it is not. I would suggest other hotels such as Brunton Boatyard or even the Taj Gateway over the Malabar.',neg
'This is one of the best, if not the best place in the area. Its India, and dont expect a Thai style flawless service and serene surroundings, but its a lovely little place, in a stunning area. The area itself is in Christmas season rather overrun with tourists  but worth going to for the journey alone. We would have enjoyed our stay, but were shown up, past lots of lovely bungalows  to our room, around a corner and down a hill, dark, damp, unclean and smelly. We paid a lot of money, should have had a good room  but they were full and using all available space. This is just greed, and left a very bad state in our mouths. Also watch out for the obsequious restaurant (food 4/10) manager who will try and push overpriced wine on you with lots of less than genuine smiles. They must make a fortune on pushing this $40 vinegar! The management were unresponsive and complacent... I would like to advice you against going, but it is the best place in the area, it is India  so go and enjoy with your eyes wide open!',neg
'We were very disappointed by the refurbishment - inside it still looks like part of a chain, with very little character. A hotel which looks so attractive from the outside should have more character on the inside.The first thing we had to do was open all the windows as the heating had been turned up to the maximum. This enabled us to discover the layer of dust on the window sills. We were also unable to access the promised satellite channels on the TV. The main problem, however, was the noise during the night. We were in the room directly over the entrance and because there is no double-glazing at all or no other attempts at sound-proofing, the noise of the traffic and people going home from clubs at 3 in the morning kept us awake much of the night.The one redeeming feature was the breakfast.',neg
'he Oberoi Bangalore is probably one of the finest hotels that the Oberoi family has built. Bookings are recommended well in advance as the hotel is running so full to capcaity that it has to at timesmake alternate accomadations for some guests who are unfortunate enough to reach the place and discover that they cant get a room because someone hasnt checked out or because of a mistake by the reservations staff. The hotel is located bang on MG road which is the heart of this southern city. The hotel is designed beautifully with very well appointed rooms and is infact as i was told by the staff a member of the leading hotels of the world (this for those who know the importance). The restaurants and the bar named polo club are world class. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is primarily a place for buisness travellers. It has fully functional buisness centre with high speed internet connectivity, fax machines,printers, photocopiers,etc. The chefs are excellent as are the guys tending the bar. Truly a luxurious place to stay in.',neg
'First night away for 3 years without the children so was loking forward to the break! What a let down!! On arrival had to wait about 15 minutes to check in as they couldnt find our booking. Was told they didnt have it, then they found it! Bed sheets had a massive hole in it which MUST have been noticed when making the bed. Also the bottom of the bath was black(the bit you stand in for a shower) which didnt look very appealing.Very noisy at 06.00 (could have been the kitchen) and could hear the t.v. above and heavy footsteps at 23.00 night before so didnt do alot of sleeping. Breakfast was good. Plenty of it and tasty, but overall didnt have a good experiance and wont be returning.',neg
'I stayed at the Leeds Met for a conference and was disappointed to find that the internet access was both limited and expensive. The rooms were clean but seem to be variable quality - mine and my colleague\'s were quite different in terms of size and lighting. The bed in my room was so soft I considered the floor as a more comfortable option. Catering was ok, but nothing more. Lunch was the same each day, morning coffee indistinguishable from tea!Overall I have to give this a thumbs down, but it may be ok for an overnight stay in a city centre location.Liked &#x2014 Location',neg
'Entirely agree with Traveler1712Mumbai what has to say about the Hotel. It\'s a over priced hotel, and with the same price range you can get a better hotel at a better location. The most irritating thing is there\'s no free Wi-Fi - the guest are charged 160 INR per hour. Are you kidding - Are we in the 90s? Also I was charged 450 INR for spilling some wine on the duvet.The Staff need to be told that they work in the hospitality industry - A little bit of smiling won\'t kill them. The hotel is way too far from the Baga and Calangute area. The closest beach is Vagator - which is pretty sad.Take my word, give this a miss - You can do much better with this pricing in Goa',neg
'Good location for the centre of Leeds.Public areas nicely laid out and modern.We attended a party in the hotel on one evening of our stay. Good service and hot buffet food was good.Our room was on the 6th floor, lift to the 5th floor and walk up the stairs for the 6th - we only had a small bag but would be inconvenient for anyone with a case.Just as well we didn\'t have a case you couldn\'t swing a cat in the room!6th floor had a musty dampish smell.Room was reasonably laid out but small! Old TV, could do with a proper clean and dust of fixtures and fittings, grime and mould on window pane, creaking floors and could hear every sound from the room next door, woken by people getting up early or going to bed late....Bathroom poor, grimy in areas, grouting quite bad. Heat control for the shower was lying at the side of the bath hence unable to adjust the water temperature (not that you wanted to spend long in the shower!)Breakfast on Sunday ok-ish, Standard offering but the hot items were on a buffet service. On Monday hot breakfast was on a table service basis and very meagre offering.... not much taste and something very odd about the baked beans!!We had a fab weekend because we saw old friends, and had a good party however the accommodation was less than inspiring!Room Tip: Find another hotel....See more room tips',neg
'We visited Shalimar Spice Garden at the last minute in late September 2005 as another booking had fallen through due to bad weather. I had seen the website and all the listings of this hotel in the Taschen books and so was excited to go. However, after all the hype, we were pretty disappointed. We visited in low season and found that 5 new cottages were being built near the pool and the kitchen was under renovation so there was a pretty restricted menu and we were eating out of an ugly room near the pool. The spa was a real disapointment. My Ayurvedic massage was positively unpleasant. Room was nothing special. Pool was small and not very clean. Service was pretty good - they were trying hard. The one nice thing was all the bird life in the early morning. We actually moved out after one night and went to the Spice Village run by CGH Earth. That had less atmosphere but was much nicer. Perhaps Shalimar is very different when it is not low season but I really feel that if hotels are renovating they must tell you when you book. I do also wonder if the facilities can accomodate 5 more cottages.',neg
'After an enjoyable stay here a few weeks ago I booked to stay again, big mistake!The guy on reception could only described as RUDE. I\'d booked a double and was allocated a twin, when I explained this he fobbed me off with a room on the 6th floor. £99 pound for a small, out of date room that stank of stale smoke, I don\'t think so. It was only after a male friend complained on my behalf was the room miraculously changed to the standard I\'d expected and stayed in last time.',neg
'What a disappointment. Having being cheered by the positive reviews , I was expecting all that goes with a 4 star hotel but The Met did not deliver. The hotel has a beautiful lobby but the care that\'s lavished on it doesn\'t seem to extend to the rooms or service. We were welcomed very efficiently and politely but from there it was all downhill. One of our beds had a disgusting looking stain for which there\'s no excuse I can live with shortcomings in rooms by and large because not everything\'s going to suit everyone. What is inexcusable though is dismissive or non-existent service. I know there\'s a recession but it\'s false economy to have so few staff that they haven\'t the time or inclination to help. I asked for directions to a venue to be met with a shrug and a \'get a taxi\'- couldn\'t be bothered. I was willing to pay for breakfast in my room but the card left outside hours before the due time was never picked up. When I pointed this out , I was told that a member of staff had been along my corridor 3 times and hadn\'t spotted it. Oh, I must have imagined putting it out then. I\'m generally a positive person but The Met drained away every ounce of enthusiasm from me. It lost revenue from me this visit and any future business I will take elsewhere. Two words, Met....Credit. Crunch.',neg

'We were interested in booking our honeymoon trip at the Oberoi for 10-12 nights in November 2012. Despite calling 3 times, no one was able to help with prices or information other than what was already there on the website. Despite promises of a callback, I didnt hear back from the 1st and 2nd contacts, though the 3rd time I called, the lady did reply - again with no further info than what I was already aware of through the website.Sadly, all the callers werent even aware of the honeymoon package and were pushing the exotic holidays package to me. After longwinded explanations, and me giving them information on where I\'d seen the package information on the Oberoi\'s website, all they could tell me was that the package was only valid till September 2012 and I\'d have to book the Exotic Holidays package. I wasnt interested in that option - I reiterated that to them several times to no avail.As an overseas traveller, I explained to them repeatedly that I needed to organise flights and bookings now to be able to make the trip, but it just seemed like throwing water on a duck\'s back. I requested to speak to their supervisor, someone senior who could apprise me of the dates/prices, but other than the parroted spiel of how good the Oberoi was, I didnt get too much further with these first points of contact for the Oberoi chain of hotels.Unfortunately, despite reading these reviews, when the initial contact that I\'ve had with the hotel to try and book my acccommodation has been so futile, I am only left wondering what to expect if I was to actually end up spending our honeymoon at the hotel.Extremely disappointed with the booking service provided. Hopefully the hotel does something of this lack of flexibility and lack of assistance that was provided in the attempt to book our accommodation so that no other overseas travellers have to face such unprofessionalism and rigidity in the interaction with the first point of contact with the hotel.',neg
'The Udaivilas Udaipur, is a super luxury property and that is the first thing that will strike you as soon as you step inside the property.We had heard some great reviews and were told that at least a dinner is a must at this place. Both, my wife &amp I, were disappointed with our experience here. Here is what we have to say:Service: Surprisingly the service made us feel that we were unwanted here. Unlike any of the other Oberoi properties that we have been to, this was a big downer. The food was pretty much thrown on our table with very little interest shown by the staff to attend to us. Our enquiry about the Chef\'s or local specialty was met with some weird looks. What made matters worse was that a couple of tables occupied by foreigners were very well attended to. Just left a very bad taste. We were staying at the Trident (also an Oberoi property) and just had a superlative service from the staff there.Food: Average. While nothing particularly wrong with it, felt it was very bland and meant for a foreign audience and not for local taste. Further, it was served not at the desired temperature.We would like to call out though that our negative feedback was very well attended to. We got an apology call from the Service Head of the property with an offer to make it good as well (which we declined). So we do hope that this was just a one off incident.',neg

'Looked for a cheap hotel Leeds Central and found one - the Met. Hotel is a good size but only one lift for 3 floors. Hotel smelt and needed a lick of paint. I had a basic single room with a bath with a shower point - looked like it was in a time warp! Everything looked faded. The room had an old style big back tv with poor reception. The bath was chipped with a black mark at the bottom - large bath though. The hot water left sandy marks when emptying the bath. The shower was ok but sprayed everywhere - pressure reasonable. The towel was a good size.On the plus side, the staff were charming and helpful and the internet access was free and good - too many hotels charge excessive amounts for using the net. The bed was comfortable and the duvet was ok but no extra blanket in room.For the price paid, it was ok but not a pleasant experience.And I came down for my paid for breakfast at 9.50am but it was already closed.',neg
'Hello everybody , It goes without saying that a big hotel like oberoi have to choose the employer which they work there and especially the front office manager and the reception staff , i was surprised when i found that the front office manager insults one of the reception staff in front of the guest and give him an order and then left me without telling me sorry about the hard insult that he told it in front of me ... and I was completely shocked when I found that man from the reception insult back his manager when he left to all his colleague also in front of the guest .. And it is not enough but he insult too the hotel itself! ! ! I wondered why he works there after all the bad words that he said to his manager and to his working place...

I still thought it looked like a nice hotel, and it is in a very central location so I was quite excited to be able to stay there.When I got there I was shown a room with lots of exhaust noise, with a double bed. I asked the reception person (who turned out to be the manager) to show me another room that didn\'t have that much noise. Then she showed me a tiny room with a bed half the size of the one in the noisy room. Then I asked her whether it was possible to get any room that would be bigger than the tiny room without much noise, she told me only smoking rooms would be available. The smoking room was full of smoke smell, because this hotel does not have any air conditioning in the rooms. Nor could I open any of the windows. So I settled for the extremely tiny room (without ventilation, but it was without much noise/smoke). That was the tiniest room I stayed in in England. The breakfast which would otherwise cost 15 pounds was in a dining room on the ground floor. There was also a lot of noise coming from some fan, so I couldn\'t even read the newspaper I brought with me. Then, on the checkout, a very disgruntled receptionist told me I needed to pay for the newspaper that was delivered to my door. I have never been charged for a newspaper without being told that it would cost so I contested the charge. The receptionist was so rude (and I thought I had seen the worst already) and refused to help. The manager came out after five minutes of my waiting and erased the charge because she was the one who simply asked whether I wanted a newspaper or not in the morning without telling me that it would cost 70p. It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed, because of the attitudes (and meanness) of the staff, total lack of ventilation in the rooms, and generally deserted feeling of the whole establishment. I am very good at finding at least one nice point about any hotel. But the Met, I cannot find any positive factor that makes it recommendable in any way. The location may be prime but at night the area gets very deserted, without anything in the immediate environs. If you like a very soft bed, you might like the bedding.Disliked &#x2014 unhelpful (and mean) staffTips/Secrets &#x2014 smokers might appreciate it, many of the rooms are smoking rooms and are very smoky',neg
'i work for a news I Travel frequently and so wide across the globe. So am extremely familiar with grades of hospitality. This review is for the discerning traveller. I will relate our nightmarish stay at The Park, aam alleged 5 star property at vishakhapatanam or vizag. On the first of January 2011 We checked in. And were give a room. Once inside the shabby state of the room surprised me. The floor had stains. the hair dryer lying without a stand inches from the sink and potential danger for electrical appliances called water. The toilet was dirty and smelly. The phone was in the loo was missing. The open wire - all so visible.have uploaded some pictures.Well there are two ways to tackle the situation. Blow your top and throw a tantrum or take it your stride. We were on holiday and these we minor issues, so me, my wife and my nine year old daughter trooped to the restaurant for lunch. A buffet for package traveller was on. We were not part of it. We ordered and waited. Waited for 40 minutes. The staff did not offer us even water. The table wasn\'t laid. Then I walked up twice to the staff and asked them what\'s up with our order. Then the order came. We ate. And left. Took a stroll to the sea and returned to the room to leave for the town. Suddenly my daughter had nausea. She started vomiting. By seven pm she was terribly sick. By eight she had vomited seven times. Had acute cramps in her stomach. Soon my wife had similar trouble. My constitution is much tougher. So I didn\'t puke out but had a severe stomach upset. We asked the hotel\'s consulting doctor to come and he diagnosed the problem as bad food and infection and prescribed antibiotics and other medicine. Then for three days of our stay we lived on rice and curd. Didn\'t venture out. Since the ladies were so unwell we couldn\'t contemplate travel. So were booked ourselves out of vizag for 4th Jan. On 4 th Jan morning, for our breakfast reached the restaurant. Since were observing extreme caution, my wife opted for boiled vegetables. She served a very small portion and was ready to eat when she found a sauté cockroach . Alarmed she called the staff. The only thing they did was take away the plate. It was perhaps a perfect end to a wretched stay. We left the hotel. Went to The taj gateway hotel. Had our breakfast almost at lunch time. Took the flight out of vizag, and reached hyderabd. And surprise surprise surprise our stomachs stabilized within 24 hours.I have travelled too often and too long to know what bad food and what a hotel with bad habits is all about. Staff not greeting, not listening. Not laying tables, not leaving spoons and forks in olae when guest are there. We complained to the duty manager at the receptio . We we offered apologies, but I know no one meant it. My little daughter was unwell for 4 days. We spent money on doctor, medicine, and sleepless night. My wife was so sick, that she couldn\'t walk. I was offered that the hotel won\'t charge us for our food bill. I insisted I don\'t want this. But then I left as I didn\'t care. I had learnt a lesson. It came at a price. But now I could not resist the temptation of at least put on paper the horrific time we had at one the PARK properties. Learn a lesson. Or maybe if indifference is a habit, forget it.',neg
'I´m quite often travelling to India and a business trip brought me to Ahmedabad. Unfortunately the Taj Hotel Ummed is not up to the Taj Standards expected. I´ve paid 130 a night for a hotel with a huge lack of service, a very nice - but also very smelly room. So I found the hotel completely overpriced. I´ve stayed in the Aloft Bangalore before coming to Ahmedabad and the service provided by the Taj was much worse. The prices for the food were doubled, but when I went to the Gateway restaurant these guys ignored me for THIRTY minutes. After asking if can have the menu they told it would be better to take the buffet. I would not ask for the menu if I would go for the Buffet. Having the menu they did not show up for another 20 minutes so I went forward taking the buffet. Asking for the bill, again nobody showed up, but at least when I wanted to leave the speeded up.By the same time the room service was working very well, but it was still quite expensive. When I asked for the car they told me that only big cars are available. While I was still discussing my plans another indian family came and they got offered the small car. I will not complain, the big car was nice, but not necessary.But the worst thing was that the room and the air condition smelled fungi and mold. During the weekend they had a (graduate?!) party going on, so they were closing the pool and on Sunday they made another party in front of my room which was going up until midnight. I felt they are more interested in the money from the parties than their hotel guests. I have to go to Ahmedabad a couple of times per year, but I think they lost a customer. Next time I will try another hotel in Ahmedabad.Room Tip: Take a room to the pool-side, its more quiet.See more room tips',neg
'A good hotel except that the AC\'s never work. have stayed at this hotel a few times, again and again.... the air conditioning in rooms arent enough.... I was given an industrial fan which made unacceptable levels of noise, yet the hotel refused to give any discount in price. Stayed for 3 nights, the AC\'s never worked properly during my stay still so no free bee, not even a discount... not even a free drop to the airport.

'Went for a long weekend - stayed for 2 nights and booked 2 rooms. Right from the start our telephone was not working, the a/c malfunctioned and the cable tv did not work after the first 24hrs. Also, both nights sleeping was not easy...first night a party by the pool played loud music until midnight and the second night, a big DJ came and threw a party for 500 people - the bass was turned so high that the windows shook until 2:30am. Front desk was hopeless to assist - said we should have known somehow before checking in that a big party was planned. To end on a positive note, the room service guys and the waiters were great and always ready to help.',neg
'I stayed at the \'Malabad\' for a couple of nights in April 2011. Our experience was far from horrific but having read so many positive reviews I felt compelled to post something (FWIW this is my first post on trip adviser). As far as I\'m aware this is the only 5* hotel in the area so if your thinking of going to Cochin for a few days it\'s probably the place to stay but I absolutely wouldn\'t recommend an extended trip. In summary:1) the hotel Is old and in need of renovation. 2) the lobby has a horrific smell3) the rooms stink of smoke (and I\'m a smoker!)4) the food really isn\'t up to scratch, in fact it\'s pretty poor5) the service in the hotel is comical, very Faulty Towers. The staff don\'t appeared to be trained6) the pool area isn\'t great**if you want to spend some time in Kerala go to the Taj Kovalam (it\'s absolutely first rate) and visit Cochin for a few days.Room Tip: Go for max 2 daysSee more room tips',neg

'I stayed in this hotel for 7 nights, and was there for business. My room was on the 5th floor and from the minute I walked into it I had to put the fan on as it was SO hot and uncomfortable. The fan remained on for the whole 7 nights. The room was very dark as the window was overshadowed by a black metal fire escape. The room was shabby and decor very dated. I was there on a corporate package and apart from breakfast the meals were dreadful. Restaurant was jam packed with other delegates from other courses at lunch time and the food selections were not topped up as they ran out. It was like school dinners but more chaotic! Other delegates using other rooms had their noisy coffee sessions outside our work room and it was impossible to concentrate when they were outside on a break. In the evening our menu was very limited and repetitive, vegetables almost raw, and on many occasions I preferred to miss dinner altoghether as the choices were not what you would expect from a 4* hotel. We had an argument EVERY night just to get a dish of ice cream instead of dessert for one of my colleagues. The chef\'s menu for us was not good or balanced nutritionally, and we complainied many times. On two occasions the hotel staff actually put other folks into my colleagues rooms by mistake, thinking that they had checked out....and on one occasion a colleague returned to her room after dinner to discover another guest had been given her room, and was sitting on HER bed (where she had left her handbag!) reading HER paper!!! The restaurant staff APART FROM CHEF and reception staff were very friendly but the management could do with a major shake up to become more efficient. Our room, which was set up for the purpose of our work, was needlessly cleared by hotel staff on a couple of occasions which meant that lots of extra furniture moving had to be done. During our stay there were several Prom Evenings and these made the hotel shake from the ground floor up. Noise from speakers and revellers could be heard on the 5th floor very clearly until midnight! First prize in the competition would be one week at this hotel - second prize would be a fortnight. Glad I live the other end of the country where the managers of hotels are more organised and user friendly. Not a place I would ever want to revisit.',neg
'This hotel has the worse customer service I experienced in all of India. First there wasn\'t a smoking room available but they let me smoke in my room. Then when I requested an ashtray, they argued saying I couldn\'t smoke. Then let me. Then I requested matches the next day and they argued again, then they let me. Why no one put a note that they allowed the smoking I will not know. Ridiculous. We had a business presentation scheduled and the men came and set up the equiptment. Then they showed up halfway through our event to take it down. We said no we want it for another hour and they stayed in the room, playing with the microphones, standing at the podium and would not leave until we asked them 3 times to please leave they were disrupting our event. So rude. Then the restaurant service was the worse. First I ordered and the waiter said I should order something and I had to request my order 3 times before he would write it down. Very rude. We would request our drinks but not even get them until we were nearly done eating. The bill we asked for several times. The whole service experience at this hotel is absolutely horrible. For a business hotel to interrupt your event and have employees chatting with each other during your presentation and into the microphones was beyond horrible. I am so glad that we are checking out today and I will never stay here again.Room Tip: Choose a different hotelSee more room tips',neg
'1. LOCATION. The hotel is just back from the main road, and is near to Nehru Bridge so fairly near the centre of the city. It takes 45-60 minutes to the airport depending on traffic.2. SECURITY. No personal security screening on entry only quick check on taxi at the gate.3. ROOM. It initially looks like a perfectly clean average room. But on closer inspection I found: stained towels, dirty cushion, old blood stains on the bed linen. The walls are very thin and talking in next room is irritating to hear. There is no bath. The luggage rack and clothes hangers are in the bathroom! There are dents and scratches on the room walls. The TV channels are different to what is published in the room. No CNN, no BBC World, no English version of Discovery, clearly not intended for international travellers.4.RESTAURANT. This was almost empty in evening, just two guests and one cook, no waiters or maitred! Improved 15 minutes later. Food was perfectly reasonable. 5.BREAKFAST. No teaspoon. Toast machine only partly functioning. Toast had to go through the machine four times to get it toasted. No orange juice, but some other coloured juice with no name. There is muesli, porridge, pineapple sections, hard boiled egg on toast. Coffee has curdled milk in it and was out of a poor quality packet, not even up to Nescafe standard.6.GYM. There is a gym but it has very limited facilities in a small room. There are two good running machines. The outdoor pool is very small and overshadowed by trees so leaves get into the water..7.SERVICE QUALITY. Very poor, I would give 2 out of 10. The waiters are not trained, or if they are, even worse, they have forgotten their training. The security staff did not do their job and did not check people coming into the hotel. The maintenance staff need to be given safe equipment. I had an extraordinary sight of the pool cleaner putting bare wires into an electrical socket because the lead had no plug on it. 8. AIRPORT SHUTTLE. The hotel says it provides a shuttle service. I met the hotel staff at their desk at the airport, and said I had a reservation and gave my name, but they did not offer a shuttle to the hotel. When I had got my bags they had left the stand so I had no choice but to get a pre-paid taxi.9.COST. For this four staff hotel the costs are reasonable for India for a standard room. Buffet dinner for 500INR. Internet 500INR. It would be classed as at most a 2 star hotel in the USA.10. Would you recommend it ? No.',neg
'This is a two-star resort at the most. My husband and I went there to get a week-long ayurvedic treatment and to relax. I am also a journalist and travel writer and was hoping to write a story on the resort. But my own experiences and those of most of the guests at the hotel made us leave three nights after we got there. We had paid in advance and were refused a refund, but I made a call to the owner of the resort who lives in Delhi and threatened to sue him if he didn\'t give us back our money. We managed to get our money back and leave. And I want other travelers to know our Kairali saga so they never go to this resort.First, the treatment was terrible. The two doctors are clueless and massaged me with an oil repeatedly even after they found out I was allergic to it. I developed a bad rash and my husband, a doctor, had to run around all night to try and get me to the nearest hospital. We never made it to the hospital because Kairali has no means of moving guests out during a night emergency. To make matters worse there is no first aid kit onsite and the night I suffered a rash the resort water supply was shut off so I could not wash off the oil.The rooms are just ok and the bathrooms terrible. The kitchen is good but the options are limited. Other services are below standard as well.What saves the day are the beautiful gardens but that is the last thing you notice when you are sick and unhappy! Strangely, we made some great friends while we were there because everyone was bonding in the face of Kairali misery. In fact, we all vowed to put up a website trashing the resort. But we feel sad for the local employees at the mercy of an owner who has very little business sense and fewer ethics....So BEWARE of Kairali.Liked &#x2014 Rural settingDisliked &#x2014 Everything elseTips/Secrets &#x2014 Don\'t go',neg
'The hotel looks nice. New hotel. However, a lot of negatives associated with poor customer service. CONSTRUCTION AT NIGHT! Yes! I did not misspeak. Construction during the day, at night. I came back from work around 9:30pm and there was banging on the wall, I spoke with the hotel staff and they told me that it will stop by 10pm. However, it did not. I had to call the front desk 5 times before just going down at 1:30am and getting them to come with me to hear all the banging and electrical saw usage. That was at night. There was also similar construction during the day - jackhammering and hammering. It was horrible. The staff were not any help. They would tell me everytime I complained We will call them and tell them to stop in 2 mins. That was their response. The internet at the hotel was $80 per week! General Manager was no help. He told me he will get back to me, I am still waiting. The front desk, either they don\'t understand what to do or don\'t care. The waitstaff, except for one guy, was NOT helpful at all. If you want to take your food out to the pool and eat there, they will tell you YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED. The young chef there was good though. Overall - TERRIBLE customer service, but the hotel looks nice. Try GATEWAY hotel across the street, much better service.',neg
'I stayed at the Met hotel in Leeds in 25th Feb and it was booked through super breaks as a two night deal with dinner and breakfast.On arrival reception were pleasant. I got to my room and found that there was a bare lightbulb without a shade on it and blood looking stains on the bed sheets. I called reception and the duty manager attended within minutes. He arranged for the bed to be changed and claimed that ge already knew we had a light with no shade and was going to deal with it. Why would you check people into a room like this?Dinner was another calamity. Waited 40 minutes for our drinks and that was after 4 requests from us. Food was nit to my icing and perhaps the choices would suit others.Breakfast was another misery. We joined a large queue and were told that tables needed cleaning and asked us to wait in the bar to be called. They left several guests there for 30 minutes and basically forgot about us and started letting new guests into breakfast which meant that the tables were taken again! Nit a good choice of food and a lot of it was Luke warm.In top of this, we had no sleep as the ceilings are thin and you could hear people above you. We were also opposite the lift which made an annoying bleep!After such a terrible start we opted to leave a day early as this wad in our eyes a hotel from hell.',neg

'Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Kiran paul and I am a resident of Visakhapatnam. On September 12th 2009 I celebrated my engagement function at The Park Visakhapatnam.I booked the hotel lawns to celebrate my marriage reception for the 9th of Dec 2009. My total guest list is for a round 350 people. I wanted a round table seating arrangement.Initially Mr.Aashish Bakshi told me that the tables and the chairs would be provided by them. I wanted a custom based menu for the wedding reception and also the cutlery(fork and quater plate) to be placed on the table. I had been requesting your hotel staff from the time I was asked to pay an advance amount to give me the menu as discussed with them. A week back when I called Mr.Aashish Bakshi he very cooly informed me that he was not in town and that he would discuss the menu after hereturns on 18th of November 2009.Since I had prior committments and was leaving for Chennai on 12th November 2009 I stressed to Mr.Aashsih Bakshi that I wanted to finalize the menu and the cost. He then directed me to meet Mr.Rajesh Chatterjee who gave me the menu card and asked me to finalise the menu we desired and then he would decide on the cost.When I decided on the menu and asked Mr.Rajesh the cost he started giving me excuses that the chef is not avaliable and he would give it to me on friday. On friday I again called Mr.Rajesh and he gave me the same reason saying the chef is not available and told me that he would give the cost only after the chef returns from leave.I was totally shocked and annoyed by the way park was handling the issue. So i called Mr.Aashish Bakshi and asked him what the delay was in giving me the cost for the event. we never expected that this delay was actually to show up there greediness by introducing brokers into their business and then force us to take outside suppliers and get themselves commision from them (brokers) This is the only 5 star hotel amongst all i have seen till today who plays such cheap tricks to fill there pockets.Mr.Rajesh Chatterjee called me up at around 8:00pm and just gave me a figure that it would cost 1900 per plate. So i went down to the hotel yesterday night because i wanted to discuss the various options suitable for me.The per plate price on my engagement day was 600/- and now he has increased the plate to 3 times more which is ridiculous.and when we asked him of why do you charge 3 times higher rate for the same plate, he said that the prices can be changed any time and any ways in a verry rude manner.for every question he simple answer was a big NO, we cant.Am surprised to see a C grade employee in a five star hotel.I have been a customer of The Park since long and have stayed in your hotels with my family many times in calcutta and chennai, But never saw this kind of Manager who has no knowledge of how to behave with a customer.I immediately had to cancel the bookings i made for the mid of november in The Park chennai, dissapointed with your hotel staff behaviour.I was extremely upset by the way i got the answers from Mr.Rajesh Chatterjee. He remained rigid about the price and told me to take the lawns and get a supplier from outside and that he would not supply the tables and the chairs also for the event. This attitute was so unexpected from an employee who should have tried to understand the customer\'s needs.I then thought of an alternative to this problem and asked them to give me the usual menu they always have for a dinner event(Non-Vegetarian)When i celebrated my engagement on the 12th of September 2009 at Neptune Hall they charged us Rs.600/- per plate for the same menu with 3 non-veg. But yesterday when i asked him the cost for the same menu he said it is Rs.1200/-. The reason he gave for such a steep rise which is 100\% increase was\' because it is December month.\' How can your hotel charge like that when we were never informed about these changes. I am shocked by the rude and irresponsible behaviour of Park employees. I had opted for The Park imagining it as a five star hotel and expected the same service we had earlier, but the behaviour shown by them is nowhere near to a five star hotel.Mr.Rajesh Chatterjee very arrongatly told me to take the lawns and get a caterer from outside. Is a five star status given to such hotels which encourage outside food? The manager tried to take advantage as he knew that the reception venue is already printed on all the wedding cards and thought that we would have no option but to play for his tunes.Your employees were behaving like brokers who wait for commission. I have never seen a hotel with a five star status behave like this. Due to this disappointment i am completely cancelling all the arrangements i have planned with The Park hotel.Also i payed 45000 as advance, and now they insist to pay back my advance amount.',neg
'We travelled to Hurghada from Sharm El Sheikh, where we stayed at the Four Seasons. We were expecting the Oberoi to be excellent and were looking forward to our stay.This hotel is a big disappointment and no comparison to other hotels in the same price bracket. Reception was overstaffed, inefficient and unfriendly. Service is slow and variable. Rooms are big, clean and do at least contain a private courtyard. Resort landscaping is poor and unattractive. The hillside was also very very windy when we visited.For some bizarre reason the hotel insisted on taking the seals off the bottled water in the room, making it impossible to tell whether the water was refilled or new. Replacement bottles inevitably didn\'t arrive.The place is slightly too big to walk easily to/from rooms and yet the small buggys used to transport people can take 15 mins and a couple of phone calls to arrive.Food was OK, the Indian restaurant was good although room service was not. The place felt half empty, which is not surprising considering.The reason I am rating this so poorly is clearer when you compare the Oberoi to other similarly priced hotels. We paid more at the Oberoi than at the Four Seasons Sharm and there is really no comparison whatsover. If you want to stay at an excellent hotel on the Red Sea coast, please think very carefully before including this resort in your plans. I will never return, but look forward to returning to the Four Seasons as soon as I can afford it!NB - The ferry from Sharm to Hurghada works OK, takes around 2.5 hours and the airconditioning is variable (or not working).

'The location and structure of the hotel and its rooms is divine and everything that the pictures promise. The Red Sea is beautiful windy but then we were warned of that. The courtyard outside our room gave sanctuary from the wind and we were very happy. The snorkelling is easy to access and excellent.Egypt was not, in our experience, a fine culinary experience. Their best wines were modest mid range and the food was limited with few exceptions both in hotels and restaurants. However, in a 5/6 start hotel like this they should have done much better than they did. During our stay of 7 days we had 3 soiled napkins delivered to us so you need to check carefully. We had plates which had been recycled on a number of occasions greasy, not dirty. We ate in the courtyard restaurant on 4 nights. The food was very ordinary not special at all. Service was very slow as there is only one kitchen for the whole hotel and food comes out in batches. The management of the dining room was non-functional. One night the food was actually cold not cool but cold. We complained and were not charged. The general manager came to see us as gave us another free dinner. By this time (night 5) the wind had abated and we were able to eat at the outside restaurant by the pool. Here the food was better, but still not at the sort of level that should expected and we ate 3 times there well. This didnt spoil our holiday. We had had 10 days in Cairo/ on the Nile Sunboat III with A&ampK first and nothing could spoil that. But this hotel was not worthy of the standard promised and paid for.

So I told him: Goodbye, but he still kept staying in my room, so I became frightened and I strenghtly opened the door and I pushed ihm out.

It happened the same to some other people .My husband called me in the evening, they didn\'t pick up the phone.......And at the end the bill was not correct, and I had to complain again......So, even if the garden is beautiful (the pool side has only 4 deck-chairs, and you have to reserve one already at 8.00 o\'clock!) I couldn\'t relax very well because everyday another problem was expecting me........The hygiene in the treatments rooms is not very good. Sometimes I asked them to change the towels where I had to sit or where I had to put my head for the treatment because they were VISIBLY dirty. In a really good center it shouldn\'t happen.So, I can\'t recommend the Kairali Ayurvedic Resort at all.Beware of Kairali.',neg

'As previously stated on many, many occasions, this should NOT be a four-star hotel. It needs to be reclassified by the powers that be. It\'s by no means the worst hotel in Leeds (I\'ve stayed in most over the past two years) but it has its flaws, and these are highly noticeable. It is, however, the worst four-star hotel in the city, without question. The lobby is fine, but beyond this, the hotel and its rooms are not.It\'s in a perennial state of refurbishment. I stayed there 2 years ago and again recently, and there have been very few changes. It\'s fine preserving the brickwork, but that doesn\'t provide me with a cold drink from the minibar at the end of the day. It\'s also very, very noisy. Whilst the hotel are emptying the bins at stupid o\'clock, simultaneous testing of floorboard declibel levels seems to get underway. Gaping gaps in the door let in every call of owshkiiiipping, and the traffic noise is less than obscured by windows that, although unopenable, seem to magnetically attract unwanted sounds.It isn\'t charming. It\'s rickety. You may well get a cheap rate, but comically overpriced extras such as car parking, the prospect of a £9.95 cheese and tomato sandwich (come on - it\'s a sandwich!) and internet access at £15 A DAY would rocket any rate beyond what are clearly finer hotels in the city, and ones which offer better value when it comes to those little extras.Avoid these, get a cheap rate and it\'s barely a 3/5. If you\'re planning on making the most of your stay in Leeds, avoid. There are many, many better hotels. Whilst it\'s official assessment is more than a little ambitious, its tripadvisor rating doesn\'t lie. If viewed as a very good two star hotel or an average 3 star hotel, you mightn\'t be disappointed.',neg
'My husband and I spent two nights here on a trip through Southern India - just beware, we thought our travel agent had booked us into the Spice Hotel in Kilumy and it was not until we turned off the main road and climbed up the hill on to a track that we discovered our mistake! While the location is good and quiet, it is away from the main town and all life - it is really quite a drive down for a meal in the evening. You could not stay here unless you had a car and driver at your disposal.The hotel consists of a main building which houses the reception and area and dining room and then various bungalows/cottages arranged over the hillside. The main area is approached from the road over a narrow, pedestrian only, suspension bridge. The bungalows, we felt, were rather close together. We were told that this hotel has recently changed hands and is slowly being renovated. We were in one of the \'elegant cottages\' which had already been renovated and it was excellent. A large bedroom, brand new bed and beautifully furnished. The bathroom was good and apart from a problem with the lavatory, worked well. There is no airconditioning as the manager informed us that it was very cool at night. One of the nights we were there it was raining, and quite warm. It is such a pity that when they did the renovations they did not put screens on the windows, as then we would have been able to open them at night. As there were a lot of mosquitoes around during our stay, this was not an option. They did fumigate our room at our request. There was a large completely private verenda with a large day bed, but unfortunately, the lighting was so bad, we could not read our there after dark.The real disappointment with this hotel was the restaurant which was very poor - both the atmosphere and the food. These were so disappointing that things like the cracked and chipped china really annoyed me!! This hotel could be excellent with a bit more input and better staff training and a complete refurbishment of the restaurant - inside reminded me of a school cafeteria and the outside area was so gloomy looking that in our time there, we did not see one person using it.I would suggest that if you want to get the \'feel\' of the area that you stay in one of the hotels in town, if you want a complete rest and \'opt out\' this is for you, in one of the renovated rooms, provided that you are not too hungry!Liked &#x2014 Our cottageDisliked &#x2014 The food and restaurant',neg
'Had a bad feeling when I walked in. Stacks of chairs in reception, a queue to check in, grubby corridors and an equally grubby lift.Got to my room and I really would not have stayed if it was free. Little bigger than the small double bed in it and unbelievably shabby. Falling apart would be my description.Worse still, when I went back to reception to ask for an alternative was the staff \'s attitude.....not impolite, but this quite clearly was a common issue. No problems getting my deposit back and no quibble at the suggestion that the website was mis-representing many of the rooms in the hotel. I very definitely was not the first to complain.Never ever ever stay here. It is aweful.Disliked &#x2014 Dirt and delapidated',neg
'The bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept on in an hotel and the room was fine. The quilt was 10.5 tog and although we requested something lighter it was not forthcoming and we had to use the one in my Dad\'s room. We ate out in the evening at the Red Chilli nearby which was very good but the hotel breakfast was spoilt by poor service, we had to take things such as toast and salt from other tables and there was no orange juice even though we had quite an early breakfast.Although it has been said before, we felt the parking was ridiculously expensive at £10-it should be free to hotel guests.We don\'t feel this hotel deserves its four stars because of the shoddy service and expensive parking and we would not recommend it.Liked &#x2014 Comfy bedDisliked &#x2014 Poor breakfast service',neg
'The headline of our visit was the attempt of the reception staff to make 3 rooms (booked months in advance) into two rooms. Our party of 3 couples was asked to slim it up to one suite and one room, which at first sounded amazing. However, the suite living room would be made into a bedroom using dividers, and to go to the restroom the couple sleeping behind dividers would have to go pass though the other couples bedroom. Funny thing is, that we were asked to do this as a \'favour\' to the staff because of a booking glitch: since when do guests in 5-star hotels ask guest for such favours (sharing toilets with other rooms and sleeping behind dividers in a living room)? Putting pressure on the staff, pointing out that they should have alerted us prior to arrival or at least have arranged for other accommodation, they miraculously arranged three rooms for us. This left them to torment later check-ins for the same favour (instead of simply arranging other accommodation for the guests). Fortunately for the staff, cheerfully drunk Britons appeared later on who were happy to sleep in dorm-like accommodations (as we witnessed in from the bar in the reception later on). This is simply not up to scratch for a 5 star facility, and only putting pressure on the did they compensate us with a free meal. Additionally, the managers gave us late check out as a compensation but they called us later in the evening putting pressure on us to check out at normal time. All in all a ridiculous check-in that lasted more than an hour, and not exactly up to Taj standard.The rooms were nice and clean though far from spacious.The pool area is borderline ridiculous for a 5-star hotel. It has the service level of a 3-star hotel, dirty ground (ever heard of jet washing?) and the view is awful: who enjoys lounging at the pool with a view of the new industrial port in Kochin?The fish restaurant is AMAZING - the best food of our stay in Kerala with amazingly friendly service. The welcome drink is LOVELY if you get the bartender to juice it up with some vodka as we did in the evening in the bar.If staying, remember that the location is quite far from the city and airport. And the facilities really do not justify a stay confined to the premises, so we recommend to book some of the good hotels closer to the city such at the lovely Ramada Resort. We aimed for a relaxing last day in India with luxury but got a hotel that didn\'t live up to standard. Do not expect the comfort of a 5-star hotel here - it is busy, not up to scratch and poorly managed.',neg
'this is the first time for me to write a review: or we like the place and then we go back, or we don\'t, and then they will never see us again. This time however I felt so disappointed (and I can\'t understand why other guests still like this place!) that I had to write about it.Hotel: resort is unattractive, worn out bathrooms and furniture. Armchair in the patiowas broken but never replaced. The shower door to the garden was stuck, was never repaired...etcrestaurant: disgraceful by any standard! Quality of the food was even worse than what you get in a bad kebab restaurant. Red wine was always too warm, so they put it in a ice bucket or just put ice cubes in your glass. Red meat that should be tender was more like sole leather, while the vegetables were still uncooked....etcservice: even worse. Housekeeping was at nauseam to be carried out at 6 pm, when you were bathing/resting/preparing for dinner. Clean?? oh no! patio table was sticky and dirty when we arrived, and still sticky and dirty the next day and... yes! I had to clean it myself. Breakfast tables were never cleaned properly, always sticky from the fruit and fruitjuice and other things from previous guests. Food remained on the tables long after the occupants had left. The 5* prices of this food however were never forgotten!',neg
'First off, we had 5 people from my company stay here on a business trip. The first night, we ate at the Rim Naam restaurant and two people ordered the shrimp, I had the chicken. The two that had the shrimp, got food poisoning and ended up in bed the next day. The manager blamed the supplier of the shrimp.The 3rd day, I go down to have breakfast (buffett), I pour some All-Bran cereal in a bowl, pour some milk, go back to my table and start eating. i notice a large amount of something really tiny, looking very much like flax seed. At first I think, is it a bug? but then I said, no it can\'t be, it is so small and looks like flax seed and they must have augmented the all-bran with some flax seed. I continue eating and then I notice that one of the flax seeds had some legs and was moving! I showed it to a colleague sitting next to me and he pulls it out with a spoon and places it on a plate and it starts crawling!Folks, no exggaeration, it was a whole infestation of bugs in my cereal. i\'m not talking about 1 or 2, i mean an infestation! I call the waiter to get the manager, they were all very appologetic. They again tried to blame the supplier. I mean really? supplier? come on. Kellogs ships these things in prepackaged boxes from Europe, they arrive in India and I doubt that the supplier opens them up and pours them in bigger containers to distribute within India. They distribute the packaged cereal to Oberoi and then Oberoi stores them. Oberoi has a problem in the kitchen!Lastly, the upholstery was stained. The carpet needed cleaning, the couch in the room was dirty. I have stayed at the Leelah hotel before and my company due to budget cuts, decided to put us up at the Oberoi. The good news is that our VP was with us and witnessed everything and he said that he will make a policy change to where we will stay next time at the Leelah.My experience at the Oberoi was just disgusting.Liked &#x2014 The lobby looks niceDisliked &#x2014 Rooms were stained and we got food poisoning and bugs in our cereal!',neg
'Stayed here with my girlfriend for only one night thank god. The hotel does not look anything like it does on its website. It is extremely tired despite a recent \'overhaul\'. Our room was tiny, dirty, dark and hotter than the centre of the sun. There was mould around the taps in the bathroom and the window only opened one inch, no exaggeration. Our rrom door had holes in it and the room was unkept and dirty. The concierge, the one with the ridiculous glasses, was anything but welcoming, totally rude infact. Will not be staying again.',neg
'Having stayed in the Four Seasons in Sharm in September 2005 we decided to return to Egypt for a short break the following year and try a different hotel in Hurghada one that was a member of the Leading Hotels of the World this time. The first surprise when you arrive is how barren in is, the Four Seasons have a lush oasis of gardens so green that you forget you are really in the middle of the desert. However on entering the room we loved it, nice layout, fantastic deep bathtub, shower door to garden and fairly large private patio area to rear, the rooms are in fact adorable possibly better than the Four Seasons. The spa was very enjoyable, good facilities and great therapists (mostly from the far east). The restaurant food was limited, medicore and certainly not worth the 5* prices, I would be happy to pay double for the food, if it tasted 10x better!However, what really counts to me in a hotel is service and facilities, and the service was appalling. Perhaps we were spoilt in the Four Seasons but they appeared to have double the staff all of which are helpful and welcoming, the Oberoi staff seem to be overworked and functional. Don\'t expect any ice in your drinks by the pool, or for your sunlounger to be straightened and towels folded while you go in for a dip. Although you probably won\'t be going in for many dips - the pool is freezing, it is not temperature controlled and this isn\'t even mentioning the flocks of seagulls that circle it, bathe in it and crap in it. The area around the pool is small, there is not much shade. The beach is barren and windy, the swimming area is badly sheltered, suffers from choppy waters and was full of jellyfish while we were there, the resort was badly lit at night to the point of being dangerous and the snorkelling was not as good as we hoped.Lastly my Fiance and I were both sick there but have not been sick in either of our trips to Sharm, he is also quite hardy and it is not often food upsets him.This has the potential to be a great resort, add some greenery, improve the lighting, build a second lagoon pool (perhaps keep the cold one as a lap pool - it is next to the spa), retrain the staff and double their numbers and it would be lovely, the architecture and layout is really nice it\'s just such a shame it couldn\'t be that little bit extra.All in all we would not return, in fact this year we went back to the Four Seasons in Sharm, just to ensure it really was that good, and really, it is!Liked &#x2014 The RoomsDisliked &#x2014 The Service',neg
'We stayed here during our Honeymoon trip on September 2010. The hotel is average but I understand there is not much choice in this area. It is damp and they are a bit pretentious considering the facilities and services offered BUT the worse part is that they tried the worst trick on us. On the evening before departure we were offered a shandy (beer and sprite) , we were trying the internet conection at the lobby (terrible signal and service BTW) before dinner so we took it. Afterwards when we received the bill for dinner I noticed there were 2 Chef\'s Special valued at 22$ (11$ each) when we complained about that charge (thinking it was a course we hadn\'t eaten) we were told it was the beer cocktail!!!!!!! The most expensive beer I have ever had....not even NY, London, Sweden....Considering that in Spain a shandy goes for $3 in the most expensive place I can certainly say this is the biggest rip off ever. Otherwise the food was sligthly pricier than in other places in India, in fact, lunch and dinner for two people was the same cost as the beer cocktail.',neg
'I was offered a traditional room on the top floor. I must admit the room was certainly traditional, like a throw back from a 80\'s dinner party. Tatty, cheap, tired and battered decor and furniture, a window that could not be opened or fully closed, no air conditioning (it was boiling) and the offer of the cheap, noisy, oscillating fan and the drone of traffic for comfort. It\'s nice to see £6m was well invested in the restoration in keeping with a grade II listed building.At 1am I called reception to leave. A night porter (very nice fellow) secured me another room and thankfully a fan which was a marginal step up from the previous nightmare. The room was small, a single bed and once again noisy and uncomfortable. A four star hotel, £6m investment, £2m spent on oscillating fans from Argos! It\'s a good job the service as just as bad (except the night porter)I\'m a seasoned traveler, I spend 2-3 nights a week in hotels up and down the country and I can safely say stay somewhere else, dont take the risk when there are so many safer options.The Service is a joke, as a Brit who doesn\'t complain .. for once did ! I got a very lackluster apology. Clearly this hotel needs every penny it can get, to complete floor six and acquire further oscillating fans!Terrible !',neg
'We arrived in earlier hours of morning to be greeted by staff that just didnt seem to know what they were at. They were awkward and clumpsy and had no communication skills whatsoever.I know we only paid 30 each a night for the room but what a kip. The carpets were dirty, duct tape holding the shower head together, lock on door was broken, oh and the funniest was the quilt. The quilt cover was too small for the quilt so they decided to tuck it in under the mattress. Wish i had taken a picture, priceless. Woken up about 5 in the morning by lorry collecting the empty bottles.I would love to know who gives out the stars for these hotels. No way is this a 4 star. Would be lucky to get 1.Other than that it was perfect.',neg
'Despite a £6m upgrade, the Hotel resembles a dilapidated railway station, with far too many guests and far too few staff. Rooms are small, and have been upgraded on a budget, that really only allows a paint job on a flaking Victorian shell - the rooms are hot and stuffy, and the noise from the nightime entertainment means you will not sleep until at least 2.00am. Room Service took 2 hours, and then was wrong, and a further 1 hour wait ensued. The buffet breakfast was ok except all beverages were poor and cold - but having to queue for breakfast reflected the shortage of staff to clear tables. There are many far better hotels in Leeds, this is one of the poorest.',neg
'I must start by saying we did not stay at this hotel- we stayed at the Taj Lake Palace and went for dinner at this hotel and to check it out while we were in Udaipur. The Leela Palace is positioned in the market to compete with Taj and we were excited to have dinner there on our last evening. The restaurant was a massive disappointment. I ordered duck confit and it was not edible. My husband was also disappointed with his entree. The chef came to our table to say hello and I told him about the duck which he could see I did not touch - he told me he would try to do a better job tomorrow. The overall service was cold and careless. We left greatly disappointed and wished we had not held our final evening at the Leela Palace. Taj clearly has the market on property, quality, food and service, hands down.Room Tip: The property quality, ambiance, service is not near the same quality as Taj Lake Palace.See more room tips',neg
'Well all i can say is make sure you are not allocated room 303 as a double unless you want to be very close at all times. The room was little bigger than the double comfortable bed.The bathroom was tiny. W hen you sat on the toilet you could touch the sink with your head if you leaned over slightly. Great if you have a touch of the old D&ampV , however there was no window in the bathroom and no extractor fan.In comparison 2 friend staying in room 230 had a huge room and fantastic bathroom , yet there was no price differential.

'* Don\'t expect an answer when you dial Reception - on 2 consecutive nights (Tuesday and Wednesday evening) the phone went unanswered when I tried to order room service. I had to walk downstairs (&amp they still had the cheek to charge me £5 tray charge!).* Make sure you breath in when you park your car there (if you\'re lucky enough to get a space that is) - the bays are tiny!* My room was really tired and the decor dated. The bathroom had a loose wooden toilet seat (with patchy varnish on it) and mildew on the tiles.* The only good thing about this place is the location. For the money, there\'s much better hotels about.**TOP TIP 1 - Don\'t let them put you in Rm\'s 201-206 / 301-306 / 401-406 etc which all overlook the courtyard unless you want a late night and early morning. Each of the 3 days I was there at 6am a delivery lorry arrives and spends 30 minutes loading and unloading making the most unbelievable noise. At exactly 11.30pm at night the same racket occurs again as staff fill the bins up.** TOP TIP 2 - don\'t order Breakfast in your room. Whilst at £14.95 the price isn\'t out of line compared to other hotels I\'ve stayed at in Leeds, you\'ll be clobbered with a £10 tray charge making your breakfast a hefty £25 - obscene!Room Tip: Don&#39t stay in Rm&#39s 201-206 / 301-306 / 401-406 / 501-506 unless you want waking early!See more room tips',neg

'I booked this resort after going through all the reviews. I went and stayed for 3 days .. Here is my take on the same.1. The place is okay but not comparable to a good resort. It looks lost in time.. 10 years ago it would qualify as a good resort not today2. I found it expensive viz a viz the services offered3. There are no amenities at the resort, all advertisements are just eyewashSo dint waste your money',neg
'We have been thinking about taking a trip through India staying at the Oberoi group of hotels so thought what better way to see how good the Oberoi are, a week at The Oberoi Sahl Hasheesh.Having read other reviews we knew this destination was purely Hotel &amp Red sea as Hurghada town is only for driving through. Hurghada town is certainly a place to drive through and now I would also advise you drive past the Oberoi too.The hotel is in a stunning location on the shore line of the red sea, the buildings and grounds look as gorgeous as they do on the Oberoi web site. The private beach is lovely although you can\'t access the sea from the beach due to the coral which is a great shame. You may only access the sea from the pontoon, the Oberoi do state this on their website so fine if you don\'t want to paddle.The seal life is amazing and much better than the Maldives, just standing on the pontoon so much swims past right up to the shore line.Everything else is down hill.Dining:We knew the food and drink would be expensive just like a normal 5 star international hotel which is fine if it\'s to 5 star international standards, unfortunately it\'s not.The breakfast is not too great, a bit basic and on a par with a 3 Star hotel.The lunch and dinner menu is a little limited, the food well prepared and presented however everything is very rich and there is little in the way of light food available, this is a problem when you rely on hotel dining for a week.Both of us had stomach problems by day 4/5 which lasted several days as did several other guests we spoke to. Room:Clean, nice fittings, furniture, design and well equiped. Getting a little tired in places and a few things like bath mats, toiletries and tea/coffee facilities are more £15 a night B&ampB.They are also very mean and hit/miss with replenishing toiletries and tea bags.Room servicing is hit/miss and they constantly try to carry out turn down service at 6pm while you are relaxing and getting ready for dinner.If you are really lucky like us you won\'t get a view of the sea from your room but a view of the room service trolley full of dirty linen, parked out side our suite from dawn to dusk.After a few days we mentioned this to the housekeeping manager who did have all trolleys moved to the back of the suites however this is not a new hotel and can\'t be their first such complaint.Service:The management is very approachable and we did have a long meeting with the manager and assistant manager but I am not sure they really understood our point, the current manager already having been there for 3 years.We use 5 star hotels as we expect a certain level of service and do not want to spend our visit complaining.With 5 star hotels we expect trained professional staff who put the guest experience and service first. At the Oberoi the staff are not trained professional staff, not the fault of the staff but of the management. We don\'t go on holiday to tell the staff how to clean a table, we expect them to know, unfortunately they don\'t.Similarly dirty broken table mats, leaning tables, chairs with broken frames etc. should not be used and taken out of service.Service is very patchy, should a manager be around the service will be quicker but not better or professional.Other:Decor &amp furnishng wise the hotel must have been beautiful when new, sadly recent additions are out of keeping and cheap not 5 Star. One example is the cheap laminate flooring to the Indian restaurant, bar &amp library, completely out of keeping with the adjacent granite floors and solid wood doors and trims. To name but one.Overall a hotel that thinks it\'s 5 Star just because it\'s an Oberoi and charges 5 Star prices. It overlooks the requirement to provide professional service and above all attention to detail.It\'s back to the 4 seasons &amp Intercontinental hotels for us, now there it\'s true value for money .',neg
'The hotel rests on a beautiful property with an incredible infinity pool and awesome Indian cuisine but is sadly let down by the quality of its rooms and service. The rooms have a musty smell and the bathroom had a mild stench. The amenities and interiors scream for a rennovation. It felt like a budget hotel room and not worth the Rs.20,000/- per night that we had paid. The service attitude of almost all the people was very lackadaisical and indifferent. However if one is fond of Indian coastal cuisine , the food in Rice Boat is specatular. Even the South Indian breakfast spread is very good. Compliments to Chef Rasheed for running a tight ship!',neg
'Hotel is quite good with comfortable rooms with often nice views on the see.But, it is located on Willingdon Island. This is far, far, far away from everything. The hotel does not own its own shuttle boat to go to Fort Cochin for example. 2 possibilities : take a cab which means 3 hours up and down because of the congested traffic or take the government boat which is quite convenient (10mn walk), except the fact you have to cross the dirty and dusty public works along the harbour which is not a pleasure at all.Having 5 stars means for me comfort, perfect facilities and service but the environment is also important. You have to know before booking that this hotel is located in the commercial harbour with an industrial environment.This is the main issue. Second was our poor experience at the restaurant Pepper : vegetables not cooked enough (new cuisine?) and meat ordered rare and served well done. Knife was not sharp enough to cut it.My next stay in Cochin will definetely be on Fort Cochin itself.Liked &#x2014 Animation (sunset cruise and Kathakali performance)Disliked &#x2014 The location',neg

'Stayed here while visitng friends in Leeds one weekend. Saw an offer on Lastminute and because of the recent good reviews (earlier reviews were not complimentary) decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Not a wise decision!The Metropol, is brilliantly located in the centre of Leeds but that\'s about all it has going for it. The standard rooms we saw were absolutely sub-standard. We were on the 6th floor which is not accessible by the one lift which services the whole hotel, and was probably staff accomodation at some point, the poor souls. The first room we were given was tiny, the door even hit the bed when we opened it. The bed looked like it was about to collapse and while the bedding was ok there was no mattress protector on what was a very old mattress. There were holes in the ceiling, the curtains were filthy and had cigarette burns in them, the carpet was awful and the room felt pretty grimy. The bathroom was ok but there was a lot of spiders in there on the horrible plastic ceiling tiles.The receptionist did manage to put us in another room which was a bit bigger and somewhat in a better condition - no holes at least. The shower unit was falling off the wall though and the toilet flush handle fell off the toilet. The bed did not feel as big as a standard double and was a real squeeze for two people. Also be warned this hotel had no aircon and was unbearably hot. OK there was a heatwave on at the time but I imagine the place is pretty hot most of the year. This place offers no value for money no matter what deal you get. It\'s awful, please don\'t even consider staying here. I wouldn\'t expect to see a room like this in even a youth hostel.',neg

'I have stayed in hotels around the world. Many were more fancy, certainly many were far more expensive. But I think this is the best hotel I have stayed in. We (wife and daughter) moved to this hotel after a conference at the Ramada, which was much further from Kochi. This hotel is on the central islands, between old Kochi and the new commercial center, and there is a public ferry service in both directions, though not terribly frequent. The hotel has a very nice ambiance, which you feel the moment you enter the resort. It is located on the tip of the island, with fabulous views. The pool is located on the water, and, in fact, when you swim in it, it looks like it is part of the bay. The landscape is beautiful, and every afternoon there is complimentary happy hour, with free drinks and food. later on there are free shows. In fact, we went to Kochi to watch a Kathakali show, while my wife stayed in the hotel, and it turned out that she watched the same show at the hotel, but for free, in addition to the martial art program we saw in Kumily. The service was impeccable, without being overbearing. We arranged all our trips from the hotel. Might have been cheaper elsewhere, but was very convenient, especially that we were a large group.Room Tip: At least one of the rooms has a shower that overlooks the bay.See more room tips',pos
'My wife and I spent 4 days at the Oberoi, Bangalore during our recent visit to India. We arrived quite late (at about 11pm). The very first encounter with the Oberoi staff was just so caring and considerate. Their check in was super efficient and did not require filling in endless forms. Most amazingly, we were greeted with a refreshing fruit drink and escorted to our room where the necessary formalities were concluded within a few minutes. During our stay, the professionalism of the staff was noticeably imbued with an unconditional spirit of LOVE. They were highly intelligent yet humble. They were able to solve every challenge we had effortlessly and were delighted to be of service. Right from the manager to the bell boy to the amazing staff at the restaurants - every one of them just oozed efficiency and professionalism.The standard of the hotel is well deserving of it\'s 5 star rating. The facilities were more than adequate and we can safely say that this is an exceptionally well maintained establishment.The beds and linen were outstandingly comfortable. The gardens and swimming pool were just superb and were a tranquil relief from the bustle of the city.The food was outstanding and the chefs went out of their way to produce for us some of their best recipes.The Oberoi, Bangalore was a home away from home for us.A highly recommended base for your visit to Bangalore India.We certainly will be returning to the Oberoi, Bangalore.Room Tip: Request a room closest to the elevators. This is a big hotel.See more room tips',pos

'I stayed at the Oberoi for a week in March 2010. Looking for some variety, I switched to the ITC Gardenia for the remaining week of my stay, and missed the Oberoi after just one day. The service, the food, and the internet were so much better at the Oberoi. It is almost an unfair comparison. First of all, you will never find better service anywhere. They have figured out how to do it right, and seem to be able to keep the high level of service consistent. I wish I could rate it higher, because it really is in a category all by itself. The breakfast was consistently very good. There was a wide selection, but I did get tired of having the same things after a week, which is another reason for switching, but found myself wanting to go back to the Oberoi for the high quality. I ate at all the restaurants, and was happy with each of them. They have chefs from local area of the cuisine\'s origin that provide a unique and authentic menu. I particularly liked the Thai restaurant. Even though the hotel claims the tap water is drinkable, I made sure to avoid it. They also provide bottled water, so it isn\'t a problem. All the rooms have balconies and look out over the very beautiful grounds. The gym is located in the spa area, and always has a very nice fragrance when walking in. The gym is very modern, very clean, and well maintained. The treadmills have radio and TV water, towels, reading material and even fruit was provided.',pos
'We stayed here for 3 nights in December. We arrived very late at night after a terrible journey- we were greeted with a delicious refreshing drink, shown to our rooms and managed a late night snack in the 24 hour restaurant. Unfortunately for me I was laid low by an infection that I brought with me from England, but the rest of our family had a lovely stay here-wonderful pool and situation on Willingdon Island and the staff were very considerate to me. The doctor was on the house and was there within an hour of being called. The food was lovely I am told! The staff were very solicitous to me who saw nothing but the bedroom! I hope to see more of it the next time.',pos
'My husband , who was there on a special assignment, and I stayed over 2 months at the Oberoi Hotel in Bangalore. We had already stayed there in March and when we knew we were to go back, no other Hotel than the Oberoi came into consideration. The warm welcome, the incredible staff, the comfort of the rooms and the 4 outstanding restaurants make of the Hotel Oberoi what excellence is all about. We really felt at home and absolutely everybody went out of their way to make our stay an incredible one. It is truly an oasis in a bustling city. We will stay there again and I can warmly recommend the Oberoi to anybody who will be travelling to Bangalore. You will not forget this wonderful experience. U. and Mc Hunn, Switzerland',pos

'I have stayed with a friend of mine for one night, using Delta Airlines\' frequent flyer program. Therefore I cannot comment on the value for money exactly, but the experience was just wonderful. The staff greet you, the room quality, the service, decor...just perfect! By far it was the best five star hotel I\'ve stayed in. Breakfast was also wonderful, had good selection of options including smoked salmon and specially prepared french toast for you.The only complaint: When asking for a taxi, I\'ve asked for Meru cab at the check-out. The staff recommended KK cab which she said would not take time to arrive. We took that option, however when the cab arrived, it was an old worn out Indica which was non-AC, and the cab charged INR 150 for less than a 2km distance! If it was Meru cab, it would be much better car (Nissan Mahindra I believe) with AC, and would not cost more than INR 60! Because it was Oberoi, I would have expected that they will provide at least a decent car (the driver was courteous, though).Of course, the complaint seemed longer than compliment but again, everything else was faultless. I specially liked the room on the first floor, because it was at eye-level with lush green trees in the garden and it had a sound of small waterfall (fountain?) that was soothing. When reading other comments I thought there will be some noise from Metro construction, but it was very quiet and the 2nd door helped to even keep the room quieter. Also, I wanted to bring back an Oberoi calender from the room and when asking for the permissionand during the check-out, the hotel staff even brough me a fresh brand new table calender as a complimentary gift.Thank you, Oberoi, for such a wonderful stay. We wish we could have stayed longer and one night was simply not enough to relax in the hotel. Because of the beautiful garden, I would really recommend to stay for at least few days. Balcony was really relaxing. I would definitely want to come back again.However, please consider the taxi option. The taxi that you have provided is not the five star hotel standard.',pos
'I have stayed at the Oberoi in Bangalore now four times over two years. They either keep a file on you or have great memory because my cold coffee and salmon omelet are usually being prepared for me in the breakfast room before I can order them.The truth about staying in Bangalore however is location. Stay as close as possible to where you need to go, because it takes an hour to get just about anywhere!',pos
'Got a chance to stay at Taj Malabar in March 2011 when I visited cochin on business. The hotel is however oriented more towards the leisure traveler. Ambiance is excellent, with a traditional feel, especially in the old wing. There is a new wing also now open I guess. Had lunch as well as breakfast(buffet). Both of which were excellent. The property overlooks the sea, with a view of the new cochin vallarpadam terminal. The setting is quite good. The service was good - we had a conference there. Arrangements were made well and the staff was very helpful. Only negative for the hotel would be the location - it is about 20 mins away from the main Cochin/Ernakulam town.Overall, an enjoyable experience, and I wouldn\'t mind going there again.Room Tip: The heritage wing is really nice.See more room tips',pos
'I spent 3 amazing nights at the Taj Malabar and thought I had died and gone to heaven after a 3 week visit to India. This hotel surpassed all my expectations and was such a delight at the end of a very busy business trip. From the moment you arrive, until you leave you are treated like a king or queen. Upon arrival you receive a blessing and cold drink of ginger water. All the normal check in procedures are not necessary as they anticipate your arrival and are ready to hand you the keys. The entire hotel including rooms are furnished beautifully and tastefully and every detail has been given serious attention. The aroma that constantly flowed throughout the buildings was amazing and you just felt peace and tranquility with your every movement. Spectacular views from the property, amazing meals in all the restaurants, a wonderful afternoon tea, sunset cruise and local dance entertainment. This is a must visit hotel for any travel to this area.Room Tip: 7th floor corner suite offers sweeping views!See more room tips',pos

'Having been to Bangalore many times and stayed at the Leela and Oberoi i have to highly recommend the Oberoi. The Leela has an impressive structure but the Oberoi has better restaurants, service, pool and serenity. At the Oberoi you are just another person checking in to the hotel, but a treasured guest. A guest who the Oberoi makes sure is pampered to and your preferences will always be remembered. Service is not oppressive but there anytime you need it. And tipping is frowned upon until you leave where then you can discretely put a tip in an envelope at the front desk. Forget the Leela - Stay here for the true Indian hospitality experience.',pos

'I travel internationally quite a bit for business, and this is one of my favorite hotels in the world. The rooms are extremely quiet, with a door that divides the room from the entry way and blocks the noise of the city. Rooms face inward into one of the most beautiful garden areas you could imagine. I picture that the Garden of Eden looks something like what the Oberoi courtyard does! Rooms are extremely clean and daily service of the room is excellent. Room service food is very good and always gets there upon the estimated time of delivery.The service of the hotel is by far the best I\'ve experienced anywhere. For example, one of my colleagues was traveling through Bangalore at the same time I was, and we were both at the Oberoi for one day. I came down to the Polo Club to see him, and I was walked into it one of the waiters recognized me, greeted me by name and said, Are you looking for your colleague Mr. XXX? As another example, I had forgotten my swim suit (and their pool area is gorgeous!), and said \'darn\' out loud as I arrived at the airport and the Oberoi representative was escorting me to my car. He asked what was the matter, so I told him. He offered to call ahead to the hotel and have someone go out and buy me a swimsuit. Similarly, upon my return to the airport I was late and the same representative at the airport met me at the car to help me get to my gate as quickly as possible. My itinerary did not have a date printed on it, and airport security was not going to let me into the airport to get my boarding pass/etc. The Oberoi representative took my passport and got my ticket for me so that I could enter the airport, and I was able to get to my gate on time. Normally I would never, ever, ever let someone walk away with my passport - but an employee from the Oberoi is an exception.The only two things that the Oberoi could probably do better is faster check-out when you leave (it took me a good 10 min., maybe a little more) and a little faster food service at the Polo Club when crowded. But those are very minor things. The Oberoi Bangalore is one of my top 2 favorite hotels in the world. Treat yourself!',pos
'Whether you are visiting Bangalore for business or pleasure, The Oberoi Bangalore is the place to stay.

'The Oberoi Bangalore definitely lived upto its review of being an island of calm and green soothing beauty in the middle of the chaotic city of Bangalore.

The manners of all the staff we encountered were impeccable.Our room was comfortable and had everything we required. The red button summoned the butler - alas we did not use it!There was a choice of three restaurants in which to eat including Chinese and Thai. We ate in the Garden restaurant where the food was varied and plentiful.We shall definitely look at the Oberoi hotels on future travels to India..',pos

Above all, the management and staff do take care of the visitors and indeed show attention and do everthing possible to make one comfortable and relaxed. Restaurants are good: very attentive to the different cuisines and tastes, breakfast in Le Jardin is a very pleasant experience, with organic food, top! also the Thai restaurant, I use to go there even if I do not stay at the hotel.

'We had a very good experience at the Oberoi Bangalore. This was the first time I had visited an Oberoi property, most of my 5 star stays have been limited to Taj in the past. The staff was extremely well groomed, food was good and location very convinient. There was a \'Adigas\' restaurant right opposite which offered some cheaper food options as well :) My kid started having breathing difficulties 1 night during my stay and the staff really went out of their way to help.',pos
'I suppose this is one the best hotels i have stayed at. The rooms, facilities, spa, restaurants, landscaping, balconies in the rooms were just awesome, and above all the warmth of the staff. I had never experienced steam facilities in toilets of a hotel room ever before. Breakfast was also great. Cant think about staying in any other hotel in bangalore hereafter. To top it all the DVD collection was also good for a business traveller like me to use after you retire from a hectic day. Dont have any complaints, but only praise for the OberoisRoom Tip: Any room is fine as long as you stay at the OberoisSee more room tips',pos
'I found the Oberoi property to be beautiful and the service to be excellent! It provided a relaxing oasis from the crowded city after crazy days of commuting to work and touring.We stayed in a suite (2 full bathrooms, and very large - would be more than adequate for a family), and while street noise was audible from the sitting room, the bedroom was better insulated and the noise was not at all disturbing.I particularly enjoyed the Thai and Indian restaurants, and the fresh fruit and snacks left in our room each day. There was also a decent selection of DVDs available at the front desk. The fitness center with steam room and sauna was nice, and I found add on services such as custom-tailored city tours to be reasonably priced.My only word of caution to others would be that the pool did not seem to be heated, so while the weather was quite hot, I found it too chilly for swimming most days - this wasn\'t an issue for me, but could be a problem if you\'re expecting to entertain kids in the pool. As others have mentioned, the staff really did make an effort to know us and our preferences (such as how we like our raita (yogurt condiment) prepared, our favorite type of naan, etc), and brought us a lovely complimentary dessert on our last night after we mentioned how much we enjoyed it during an earlier meal.Liked &#x2014 Excellent service and restaurants, spacious, well-kept roomsDisliked &#x2014 Unfortunately, would most likely be out of my budget for leisure travel',pos
'After 15 hours or more of travel, walking into the Oberoi in Bangalore was like a dream. My mom and I were incredibly tired and jet-lagged but from the minute we stepped into the airport\'s arrival terminal, we felt the hotel\'s dedicated attention and out-of-this-world service. Hotel\'s staff was waiting for us in the airport and we were in the airport and whisked away to the hotel by our amazing driver. Once there we were greeted with fresh fruit juice and escorted to our room for the most painless check-in process we\'ve experienced to date. At 4:30 am we felt like the whole hotel was up and ready to help us. With dawn we were able to appreciate just how beautiful the Oberoi is. My mom couldn\'t believe it. Our breakfast was beyond delicious and as we prepared to continue with our travels, the staff made sure we had everything we needed. They helped us get a SIM card for our cell phone and contact lens solution we had forgotten back home. In short, it was truly extraordinary. Our stay was way too short to enjoy everything the Oberoi has to offer. To us, it was worth every penny.',pos
'I should probably start with some info.. I travel around 12 days a month and can safely say that I have been almost all the good hotels in the major cities. Naturally, I wanted to try The Oberoi\'s(Bangalore) which was on the list. My flight was delayed for 4 hours and was very tired from the long trip to Bangalore, the Check in was amazing. The Hot towels helped a lot. I took up the executive suit and I was not once disappointed. The 4 days went by like a breeze. The hotel has beautiful landscape and my partner was naturally very happy about tall the things that she could do to keep herself busy while I am working. The hotel staff is amazingly polite and courteous.Oh The chef\'s here are genius.. I had stakes.. Momo Lunch.. Fish.. loved it all. The bakery chef went out of his way to make a large batch of cookies for us(over and over again). They have a great pool too. It is by far the best hotel that I have been to in terms of service.

The rooms had been upgarded with large LCD screens in both the bed room and study area and the wireless access was also seamless and fast. The toliletries in the bathroom were also of a high quality. Also, unlike many other hotels in India, the towels and bed linen were white, clean and fresh and did not have that damp quality to it. What struck me even more was the quality of service at the hotel. From the welcome at the Front Desk, to the room butler to the F&ampB staff at the bar and restaurants, I found the quality of service to be exemplary....simply outstanding!

'Recently we stayed at the Oberoi for a five night visit to Bangalore. The people were so welcoming on our arrival and couldnt do enough for us. The room was lovely and as it was night time when we arrived we were yet to see the true beauty of the whole place.We woke to the view of beautiful blue skies and our balcony awash with beautiful blooms.Everywhere we went in the Hotel the staff were amazing, so warm, so polite, so respectful and so genuine. The food here in all the restaurants was outstanding and again we were pampered beyond the call of duty.We were sorry to be saying goodbye to Bangalore and especially the Oberoi, they made our holiday perfect and if ever I was to recommend a hotel it would be this one.

'The Oberoi hotel was a treat that I have enjoyed during my 12 days in Bangalore.The lobby of the hotel is really big and beautifully decorated. The rooms are sufficiently large and have all the necessary amneties. The gardens are absolutely gorgeous, as are the restaurants, which also have wonderful food. The hotel is spotlessly clean. The breakfast has a large array of choices and lots of fresh juices to enjoy.However, probably the hotel\'s greates asset is the staff, and this is what turns the Oberoi from a good hotel into a great one. Everyone smiles and says hi. They are happy to help and do not expect tips. Moreover, knowing I was having my last breakfast at the hotel and that I would depart the same day, they prepared a Bon Voyage cake for me and all the waiters came to thank me for staying at their hotel. A real treat for any traveler.If I am to tell the hotel to improve something, then that would be the photos on their website, who really do not due it justice. The hotel is much better than in the pictures.Thanks to all the staff for a wonderful time. I will surely choose this hotel if I stay in Bangalore again.',pos

'What can I say - I had the most incredible customer service whilst staying at this hotel on business. I still can\'t believe it! I was running out of hairspray and my can was nearly empty - an essential item for a business lady especially during hot and humid monsoon season! It was the last day of my trip - so I just thought that I would leave it until I got home. Anyway, on return to my hotel room in the evening, a brand new can of hairspray had appeared with a note to say that the housekeeping staff had noticed that I was running out so bought me a replacement. How absolutely fantastic is that. I have never experienced such great pro-active customer service. I will defintely be staying at the Oberio for all my future business trips.

'I have been travelling for over 25 years and the hospitality and attention to detail is some of the best Ihave ever seen. I have had the pleasure of staying the Oberoi for long visits (3-4 weeks at a time) over the last six years and they continue to excel. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and comfortable. There is also a large variety of delicious food available at all of the resturants. I love sitting outside at the Polo Club.

'This was easily the best hotel that I\'ve ever stayed at, for business or pleasure. Beautiful grounds, clean well maintained rooms, and great staff and customer service! I\'ve stayed in comparably and higher priced hotels in the U.S. and got half or a 1/3 of the service. Would definitely look for other Oberoi properties for any trips to Asia in the future.',pos

'This hotel, its location, food, expertise, meet and greet routines, staff, all exceptional. If you book here try to get a room with a view over the harbour as you will get the sunset views. Go on a sunset cruise, fabulous. We were made to feel as if we were royalty.The hotel is not in the town centre, but we didn\'t leave the hotel areas so it wasn\'t a problem. Food here is not a problem, but the choice and variety will keep you busy! Taj have certainly made this hotel very special.',pos
'Only stayed for one night but I had a great stay. Staff were lovely, the gym was small but fine, the room comfortable and the views over the gardens (which I think all the rooms have) provides a nice respite from the noise outside. And it is noisy outside as they are building the new metro down the street out front. Had a lovely breakfast here too.Liked &#x2014 welcomingDisliked &#x2014 digging up the road outside',pos
'This hotel is an oasis of calm in the middle of Bangalore! Quiet and peaceful compared to the city outside. I stayed in a Premier Room which was perfect for me! Free wifi worked v. well everywhere. Staff were great - very friendly and helpful. Had a v good meal in the Thai restaurant.Only downside could be the location, but this is totally dependant on the places you need to visit during your stay - travelling around Bangalore is demanding to say the least! A short journey can take a while. But at least when you get back to the hotel, you can really relax!Not cheap but worth the money - would use again for sure!',pos
'This is one of those rare places where it is hard to fault anything. The property is beautifully maintained and an oasis shielding you from the chaos of the outside world. The gardens are peaceful and relaxing. Rooms and bathrooms (with Mr Steam) are spacious, spotlessly clean. The pool is super. Food is wonderful and the breakfast buffet was excellent - miles ahead of any buffet offered by other five star properties at which I have stayed. But all this on its own is not enough to make a great hotel. It is the staff who really make the experience memorable. Like other reviewers, I agree that Oberoi has incredibly well-trained staff. They ANTICIPATE needs and nothing is too much trouble. Staff is very courteous and friendly and I enjoyed interacting with them. Guests at the Oberoi in Bangalore are made to feel very special and that staff find it a privilege to be able to make our stays comfortable. Oberoi Bangalore has much of which to be proud.Room Tip: Any room here would be wonderfulSee more room tips',pos
'I recently stayed at The Oberoi Hotel in Bangalore. The rooms are awesome, one balcony opening towards the beautiful garden. The location is too good, just on the MG road, just get out and you are on the most happening locality of Bangalore. Their service is just unbeleivably good.',pos
'I took my family along during a business trip. The hotel yet again proved outstanding in hospitality standards. The Gen Mgr Huvida Marshall glides around the hotel observing welcoming and being the warm and efficient hostess she is. As a consequence it was delightful to see all the staff greet guests with the Indian namaste and a bright smile. Their work looked like a passion. It was done easily and swiftly with only one focus - the guest. The rooms are outstanding with superb facilities. Room service is swift and the food is good. The Thai restaurant is probably the best in the country and the coffee shop serves without doubt the best breakfast spread I have seen anywhere with the chef and staff happily willing to go out of their way to do something extra not listed in the menu. The gym is very well equipped and if you overdo it (as I did) the spa is another delightful experience. Very cheap too. I certainly intend to use it as a weekend holiday destination given its central location in Bangalore and the desire to lie back and do nothing which I believe is inspired by The Oberoi experience and the Bangalore weather.',pos
'All in all an excellent place to stay. I was on business. The staff are very nice.',pos
'stayed here twice in the past 12 months - both times were great. Staff are exceptional and food is great. Atmosphere is old world and the evening boat ride through the bay is a very nice touch. Got ill the last time I was there a few weeks back and staff were very attentive and helpful - getting a doctor to attend to see if I was ok. The previous time I was there we had an early start and the chef came in an hour early to prepare breakfast for us. This is a hidden gem of a hotel.',pos
'Access : The Hotel is Situated in MG Road (Metro Station :Trinity Circle) which forms part of Central Bangalore. If you are coming from Airport take BIAL AC Bus No. 7A which drops you right in front of the Oberoi Gate at Rs 180. It is in proximity from Garuda Mall, Ulsoor Lake, Brigade Road, Commercial Street, UB City. Check In : we landed up earlier than the scheduled check in and the Manager was please to allow an early check in. Check in is very well thought through, within couple of minutes you are in your room with your loyalty card, a welcome letter from the GM and a mini hotel guide.. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite. They offered fresh juice (grape/watermelon) on check in which was soothing. Rooms : The rooms are equipped with all modern amenities one can think of (LCD\'s, mini bar, writing desks, sofa\'s &amp so on) in a Star hotel. The beds are very comfortable with a choice of pillows you prefer. Every room has a balcony which overlooks the pool and garden equipped with a table set. Also there are beautiful flower plantations outside each room. A Book, some masala tea, serene view, birds chirping, excellent weather,make an ideal morning at the balcony. The toiletries are of high quality. The television covers most of the channels. They provided butler service which was quick and responsive, not sure if the butler service is for the suite or for all rooms.Since this hotel is on the main road traffic noise would be inevitable if you are planning to sleep in day time.Service : The best part and the intent of this hotel is their service which is known from moment you enter and is experienced at any corner of the hotel. They put every effort to ensure your stay is comfortable.Food : The hotel has four restaurants Le Jardin (continental), Szechwan Court (chinese), Rim Naam (Thai restaurant), Polo Club (pub). We had buffet lunch at Le Jardin. It had limited menu options but each item gives a good kick. The buffet is served on the table which is nice as the food is not wasted. The service at the restaurant was exemplary.Facilities :The hotel has a huge swimming pool, huge not olympic but large enough to blow your breath up. The pool is surrounded by ample sun decks and they serve beverages and snacks around the pool. The pools is amidst the garden and is lush green and refreshing. They have couple of business centers, a book stall, well equipped fitness area, steam rooms and a spa. Spa : The spa is professionally run and is at par with the services you expect. One hour treatment costs you about 5 grands. With so many spa options in the city, this facility would be expensive unless you are keen to have it at the hotel premises. Check out : They offered us late check out until 2 pm and post which we could spend some time at the facility as our flight was in the evening. Check out was smooth and quick with no errors.Scope of Improvements : 1 - Bubble bath should be offered in toiletries2 - Shower area separate from the bathtub3 - concealed wiring around the study table.4 - Cigarette butts left over in the balcony by previous guests.Room Tip: All the rooms face the pool and garden, the rooms behind the large tree have shadow all time during...See more room tipsSee all photos',pos

'This was our second stay in this hotel in the past 5 months (see Best Breakfast in the World - 31 October 2011). Yet again the Oberoi excelled in all areas, from check-in to check-out was a faultless performance from the whole team. What really sets this hotel out from other hotels is the professional and friendly service provided by all staff, without exception.Chef Jaydeep continues to get the very best out of his team in the main restaurant, where breakfast once again was out of this world. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff who are all highly trained and it is great to see that they all look like they are really enjoying their work!This time we also dined in Rim Naan, which has a fantastic atmosphere and food to match. The Tiger Prawns we had for our main course were truly special.I find the hotel to be competitively priced for a 5-star and to be honest even if it was the most expensive, I would not stay in another hotel in Bangalore. The service, the quality of food, the location and most critically the incredible staff make this hotel so great.As we head back to the UK after a year in India - I can easily say that the Oberoi, Bangalore outshines the other 20+ hotels we have stayed in and on a scale of satisfaction/Rupee it beats the rest hands down. Thank you Oberoi, Bangalore.',pos
'This is my 2nd visit to The Oberoi and as usual, it is impecable. The staff are amazingly professional and yet still manage to exude a sense of warm hospitality. A request for a firm pillow was delivered in about 5 minutes. Breakfast at Le Jardin is truly amazing - one of the best that I\'ve had in India. The attention to detail is also one of the finest points of this hotel and I will return again.',pos
'I stayed for only two days, absolutely loved it, and am planning to come back.Cochin is a paraides and the Taj is a paradise within the paradise.The corner room I had was super nice.

'Without question, my stay at the Oberoi in early Feb 2012, was the best of any hotel thus far abroad on business or pleasure and ranks in service, quality, dining and customer experience up there with any 5 star in UK or elsewhere. The friendliness of the staff, the cuisine, spa &amp gym facilities along with business essentials like broadband connectivity were outstanding. Highly recommended. I will be looking to stay at any Oberoi hotel on future travels.',pos
'We have just returned from a very special 8 night stay at the Taj. Apart from the wonderful rooms, it was indeed the team of people that made our stay so memorable. All of the staff provided Customer Service levels that exceeded all our expectations.

The property itself radiates a calm stillness enhanced by those trees and that gentle expanse of green. The food is delicious and thoroughly enjoable. And the staff across functions are attentive, quietly efficient and seem genuinely happy to be working there. And that really makes the experience quite extraordinary.

'We stayed at the Oberoi in Bangalore whilst visiting the city for a combined business and leisure trip. The hotel is well located, and whilst almost 20 years old, is incredibly well run with service levels as good as any we have encountered anywhere in the world. Staff are attentive, thoughtful, and anticipate your every need. The quality of food was of an equally high standard, in particular the hotel\'s Chinese restaurant the Szechwan Court which has justifiably been voted the best Chinese retaurant in Bangalore for over five years. In summary the hotel, its staff, and gardens are an oasis of calm in what is a frantic and noisy city.',pos
'Oberoi Bangalore is one of the hotel where one would like to come and stay again and again. They have excellent staff and their attitude. All must try once.',pos
'I stayed at this hotel on a business trip with other colleagues. The facilities are just amazing! The rooms are well appointed, and all facilities are continuously being cleaned and improved. The lobby is beautifully decorated with fountains, flowers and rose petal arrangements, etc.The staff is very attentive to the smallest details and all you\'ve to do is ask for it! The spa/sauna/steam room is clean and updated with all the latest amenities. The spool was outside and not heated, but I still saw people using it in winter, so I guess it was usable.The chinese restaurant is ok (compared to similarly priced restaurants in CA, USA), but not exceptional. However their thai restaurant does have great items on the menu and well presented. Breakfast buffet was also very high quality! They even got us some special dishes on the 3rd day when we started getting tired of some of the similar items - they even made pancakes, crepes on our request!Highly recommended for business, families, leisure.',pos

'What can I say about this place? It Fab, the Hotel is set near all locations, but secluded from the local traffic. Easy to walk from the Hotel to commercial Street and other near by locations. Not far by Taxi to get to other locations. Yes there was the noise from the fly-over that was being built at the time of my stay, but this happens when a country is building itself up to be even better.The staff were amazing, always there for you, but not to be seen, The restaurants were great, the Chef looked after me and made special soups whilst I was ill for a day. The room services was at hand every time of the day. Breakfast was tailored to suit individual choices, meaning if they did tno have something, they would make if for you, if something needs to be cooked to your tastes they would do it for you, Brill !!I visited the Leila Palace, as I had heard it was better than this hotel, Yes the hotel was better than this, but it\'s location was way out of town and no local shopping, so I would not stay at the Leila Palace, even if it was cheaperWould I stay at The Oberio, Absolutely YesRoom Tip: rooms facing the near gardens are better, as the front door will face the main road and the bedrooom...See more room tips',pos

'We were on a trip to Kerala and this really is beautifully situated, the views from the garden of this hotel are magnificent, the food is top notch and service is efficient. We had a corner room ( sunset view I think its called ) and you could see the sea from two sides of the room, beautiful cruise ships passing by and one morning it rained and it really looked heavenly. I think the only drawback would be that it is a bit far from the Fort Cochin area so getting around is a bit of a problem but otherwise in every way it is superb.',pos
'The Oberoi hotel at Bangalore is an oasis of calm in the city of Bangalore. The service is just perfect, the personnel is extremely friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Bangalore for business purposes or privately. You really feel like being personally looked after. The food in any of the 4 restaurants is excellent (great breakfast bar at Le Jardin)',pos
'Excellent Customer Service, very courteous and attentive from the doorman to the Manager. The staff is very friendly and personable. The food was magnificent, always fresh and warm, lots of variety, from Indian, American and Chinese Dishes, anytime.The ambience and decor is simply beautiful, marble floors, fresh floral arrangements daily, clean and shiny floors. The Housekeeping staff is wonderful, they clean and cater to your every need, and my laundry was always starched and pressed superbly. My most special memory that I kept as a souvenir is the mint, a fresh flower, a perfume sample called Dream along with a note left on my bed. Better than any 5 star Hotel in NY. Everything you see on the website is REAL only more beautiful than in pictures. I picked this hotel on this website only and was truly impressed and elated with my 32 day stay there. The Spa, the Ocean view is remarkable. I will never forget my stay there and will be back every two years.

'I stayed at the Oberoi on a recent business trip to Bangalore. What an experience - from check in to check out, my experience was outstanding. My room was very plush, clean, and had a great view. Because of my challenging schdule, I ate at two of the on property restaraunts - one for a business meeting. Services was fast and friendly and the food was top drawer. I only wish i had a few more days to enjoy the experience. The best of the three hotels I experienced while in India this time. Highly recomnmend you stay here. Check it out.',pos
'Let me start by stating the Oberoi has excellent service. I arrived early in the morning without an advance reservation, as my prior arrangements fell through. There were no problems with early check in, and I was shown to my room within just a few minutes of arrival.The room was spacious and very well appointed. Had a huge walk in closet (who travels with that much stuff?), DVD player in the room, and a bowl of fresh mangos on the table. Top quality room. A short while after arrival, a floor butler appeared and introduced himself. I couldn\'t think of anything I\'d ask a floor butler to do, but felt special to have one. The grounds are very clean, very quiet and very relaxing in the heart of a busy city.A few down-sides (minor): The service thing can go over the top. After a day or two, it feels odd to have the staff jump up, bow, and how to you do every time you enter a room or walk past. The internet charges are high and confusing. The hotel restaurant food was just ok, but when I marked good instead of excellent on a survey card, the manager ran after me to apologize and ask for specifics. How do you say It was ok, but I\'ve had better without seeming like you were hurting the guy\'s feelings?Overall -- highly recommended, but ask your locals for the other great places to eat in Bangalore. There are many.',pos
'This is one of the nice hotels to stay in Bangalore where it has got all th efaclities starting from Business longue access to the nice outdoor swimming pool. The food served in the hotel is so good. It has got various restaurents in it like Tahi, Chinese. Modern Gym with coach is good to spend time in the morning and evening.Coming to the service, it is the best service that I have received. Nearby MG Road is nice time to spend on weekends and a good place to shop also',pos
'I recently stayed in at The Oberoi Hotel in Bangalore, India on a business trip. The hotel stay was one of the highlights! The hotel itself is beautifully designed, with all rooms overlooking a beautiful gardened area with pool, directed away from the traffic noise as much as possible - which is essential as the hotel is in the city. The staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly and could not do enough to care for their guests. The hotel also has a complimentary airport pick up and drop off service which was very well organised. I had all my evening meals at the hotel and found the menu variety and quality of the food was excellent. They also had a lot of business and conference facilities that I did not require, but the no hassle, great connection internet included in the price was well used. if you want a thoroughly enjoyable and productive experience - look no futher than this hotel.',pos
'I spend most of my time in Bangalore on business. My wife recently visited me here &amp we decided to treat ourselves to a week\'s stay at the Oberoi. I was amazed. Quite apart from the fact that the hotel is a beautiful haven of calm &amp peace in the middle of a noisy bustling city, the standard of service was the best I have ever experienced in many years of staying at 5-star (&amp above) hotels around the world on business &amp holiday. Every day there seemed to be one small action, performed by the friendly staff, designed to make our stay more comfortable &amp hassle-free. The prime example was when I mentioned to a concierge that my favourite shop in Bangalore is \'Blossoms\', the secondhand bookshop, &amp that I study history. Next day, knock at the door &amp I was presented with a lovely book on Indian history purchased from \'Blossoms\'! Final day, lounging by the hotel pool, we were presented with a cake to wish us \'bon voyage\' for the trip back to the UK. The staff really made our stay superb. I can\'t wait to try the other Oberoi hotels in India.Room Tip: Ask for a room with abalcony overlooking the pool &amp gardens.See more room tips',pos
'I just finished my first stay at The Oberoi, and will definately make it my preferred location for future trips. I\'ve stayed it almost every western-style hotel in Bangalore over the last 8 years, and this one is at the top.From the moment you arrive at the hotel, there is the feeling of security, comfort, service, and a strong urge to wander about the well maintained gardens at the hotel. I wish I had brought my bathing suit, as the pool looked very inviting on a warm, muggy day during the monsoon season.The staff were extremely accomodating, yet they didn\'t get in the way, or hover over you trying to anticipate your every need. From the person who picked me up at the airport, to the person who made me an omlete for breakfast, all of the necessary creature features were there, and waiting for you.Room Tip: The poolside of the hotel is farther from the city streets, and is thus a little quieter.See more room tips',pos
'If you can afford it in your trip to Kerala, go for it. Anytime I come to Cochin for business or leisure, I try to book at the Vivanta Taj Malabar. Not easy to reach but once there, you will feel the old clonial british atmosphere which is very present. Quality hotel, good rooms (ask for sea view), nice pool and excellent breakfast. On week end you can enjoy local danse show. Believe me, no hesitation, the best in Cochin/Kochi.Room 410 (or any other corner room) is a good choice. Don\'t get a room in the old aisle.',pos

'Bangalore was our last destination after 20 days of touring South India. We have never been to this part of India before.We landed in Bangalore not knowing anyone and having to spend 3 days at this hotel. What a pleasant surprise! The foyer is filled with the perfume of lillies and many staff always eager to please. We enjoyed talking to the houseboys who looked after our room, and as we had all our meals there, we became friendly with all the restaurant staff. Someone is doing a good job selecting and training staff. We travel a lot each year, but they have the best staff we\'ve met! Each day we were assisted with all our queries about where to buy jewelery, extra baggage etc with a smile and a follow up soon after. We felt like we were home. Room service was excellent too. We felt the price of food was a little expensive but the quality was great. There were a couple of extra surprises when we left for home, that helped our departure to be more comfortable. If you are in Bangalore, stay at this hotel! You are in for a treat. We will return soon. Thank you Oberoi!Carole and David- Melbourne Aust.Room Tip: Our room faced a busy road, but close the second door and you won&#39t hear a thing!See more room tips',pos
'My husband and I recently stayed at The Oberoi in Bangalore and loved it. The hotel is beautiful and the grounds are beautiful. The deluxe room was comfortable, clean, nicely appointed, and has a beautiful balcony. Most important, though, is the service. You really do feel welcome at a hotel like The Oberoi. Everyone is so friendly and really makes it clear that they want you to have the best stay possible while you\'re there. The service is not over-bearing in any way. It\'s just friendly. There is also no pressure to tip each person working in the hotel. You just tip at the end and they all share it. Also important to know that you can drink the tap water in the hotel. That\'s not true everywhere in Bangalore, even in rather nice hotels in the city.There are 4 main restaurants at The Oberoi. We ate at three of them during out stay and the food was excellent in all of them. The breakfast buffet has plenty of options (Indian, European and American). If you don\'t want the breakfast buffet, they have a nice breakfast beyond beyond that. Loved our dinner at the Chinese restaurant, and we also had great lunches (Indian and non-Indian food) at the Polo Club (great outdoor seating). As always, service was fantastic at all restaurants.The pool area is beautiful. We were staying at at time when the hotel was not crowded so it was never difficult for us to get a lounge chair out at the pool. You can\'t hear the noise of busy Bangalore at all in this area of the hotel. As some people have mentioned, the noise of the streets in Bangalore is undeniable... constant honking from sun up to sun down but the double-door in the rooms shuts out most of the noise. The honking also does cease a bit after the evening rush hour so we had no trouble sleeping at all.If you\'re familiar with Bangalore, you know that there\'s no walking anywhere from your hotel. Get a good driver and you\'ll be set.',pos
'Another most satisfying stay in an Oberoi hotel! My partner and I checked in at 4.00 in the morning. We received a warm welcome at reception (including a drink and freshening towel) and as we were weary from our flight check-in was completed in the comfort of our room! Much appreciated.Our room, from the balcony (as do all the rooms) overlooked the swimming pool and spacious, well-landscaped and well-maintained gardens. The room was spacious, spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated and the \'noiseless\' AC system allowed for undisturbed sleep at all times. The spacious walk-in wardrobe was most welcome. Adjoining bathroom was of an adequate size and all toiletries, bathrobes, slippers provided. Bed linen was spotless and most comfortable.We had all our meals at the hotel and can confidently say that the cuisine is of a very high standard. Amit Wahhawan, executive chef was regularly present in the dining areas and willing to offer suggestions. My partner was particularly interested in South Indian food and one morning for breakfast, a special platter of breakfast delicacies was presented. On another occasion we enquired about a breakfast cereal and he kindly provided us with a recipe! - all this while attending to other guests, as well. Many thanks as well to the omelette chef who made us a variety of mouth-watering omelettes. My only complaint is that we were always encouraged to savour more dishes!The entire hotel exudes understated elegance. Every area from reception to restaurants to bar to gardens to pools is tastefully decorated and one is almost reluctant to go out of the hotel. The hotel is situated on the very busy Mahatma Gandhi road which at the time of our stay was \'chaotic\' with tube,road constructions but one is not aware of all this once inside the hotel grounds - therefore an oasis of peace and calm....Our greatest appreciation must go to ALL the staff, from groundsmen to management. Every member of staff is highly professional, most welcoming without being intrusive, and attentive to all our needs. No arrogance, no frills.. On the first day I was unwell and promptly received a platter of fruit and a get well card. On the day we left a note informing us of the travel and weather conditions of our next travel destination was placed in our room and a delicious chocolate \'bon voyage\' cake was presented to us. All unexpected, but most welcome. Many thanks also to Jivan (room), Rhea, Naveen, Sandeep, Anurag and Sukhant (restaurants), the cashier who helped my partner and to all the wonderful staff in reception. Your team work makes this hotel.',pos

'This hotel has one of the best service i have seen. We stayed here for 3 days and I must say that the Taj knows how to treat its people right!

'The Oberoi is name for comfort and style, I loved the interiors of the hotel rooms and it had all the facilities that anyone can have at home. Starting from Air conditioning to heater, Refrigeration to Microwaves... Interiors were very nice. It seemed that they have spend very much on the decorations. Food was very good and all other room service were very fast and were very poilte to all of us. They handled each and every kind of customer with ease and this shows their expertise.',pos
'Next week ( April 1st ) I will be at the Oberoi again and this for the fifth time in a row. Most of my meetings with my Indian customers are being held in this hotel. And my customers do appriciate this gesture because they too love to come over. Staff and co-workers are highly proffesional and help you with even the smallest problem. Nothing is too much for them. For me as an European ( Belgian ) citizen is really the best hotel I have stayed during several business trips to Bangalore. I highly recommand this hotel to all business travellers and wish you all the best stay. Bruno Bruyland ( Burg Group )',pos

'The Oberoi\'s Bangalore is a great property with probably has the best trained staff in Bangalore who do their level best to treat you with utmost care. The hotel is located is centrally located on MG road so whilst it is in the middle of the city, it is still a ride away from Whitefield / Sarjapur / Electronic City etc which are the hubs of IT - it wouldnt have been such a bad thing, except that Bangalore has some of the worst traffic in the world due to the short sightedness of the \'son of the soil\' (read dim witted, curropt) politicians and city planners who have zero common sense. Despite being a property which has been there for ages, it still retains its fresh feel and the thought put into the small things is what make Oberoi\'s unique. Pretty much all staff are young, which is a strategy with the Oberoi\'s to retain the fresh feel and the more experienced and \'grey haired\' tend to manage the show from behind the curtains. The Thai and Chinese restaurants have great reviews, however, I stuck to room service due to paucity of time. One thing I found a bit annoying though was that there is no free internet/ wifi in the hotel and it is chargable. Almost all hotels offer internet as part of the room package or is complimentary. In an IT city like Bangalore and having mostly IT savvy travellers, this is a bit disappointing as so many of our gadgets depend on internet and the cost of the offered packages was fairly stiff, thankfully I had a vodafone 3G connection on my iPad which worked spectacularly. Expect for this blip my stay is extremely good and I had a great time.',pos
'Bangalore Oberoi is one of the finest and best hotels i have stayed at. The food is amazing and so is the service. The whole experience was brilliant. The staff is very accomodating and cooperative.

'I stayed here for a week during a business trip. While travelling to India, I always try to pick a Leela, Oberoi or a top-end Taj hotel. In Bangalore I would rate this hotel second (after Taj West-End). All facilities in the room were great, very good personalized service (i was greeted using my name every morning several times and was informed nicely about cars waiting etc.). Breakfast was according to Indian top-end standards (which is not the best on a worldwide scale). Dinner buffet extraordinary. Hotel setting, even though in the middle of hectic Bangalore, was very peaceful and quiet.',pos
'The Oberoi, bengaluru has to be the best city hotel I\'ve stayed in. This when it has to compete with the opulence of the Leela, the radical ambiance of the Park and the riches of the Gardenia. To begin with it is dead in the center of the city, next door to Taj and Ista and walking distance from two metro stations and bang on the MG Road. And yet, step into the hotel and you\'d be cut off from the outside world as if you were on a retreat far away from the mess of a city. The hotel staff consider it a personal insult if you are left with even the slightest discomfort and as if their pampering wasn\'t enough, your personal butler would ensure you do not have to lift a finger during your stay at the hotel.The rooms are very well designed and sleep quality is top notch. They also boast of anything you may need during your stay and more. Each room also has a balcony on the inside with an amazing view of greenery which only a Bangalore hotel could have. The balconies also overlook the swimming pool, vast greens and two of the hotel\'s best restaurants (which by the way merit a eulogy of their own). It really is a place where all you have to do is arrive.Room Tip: Even though a second door ensures that any residual noise from the road outside is blocked, a simple...See more room tips',pos
'You will love this hotel. We did! The service was impeccable and the welcome adorable - with fresh mint and cucumber drink and bindi mark on our foreheads. The hotel was beautiful and they give you quite a lot of complimentary things e.g. boat trips along the river, afternoon tea in the courtyard ... nice touches. The Rice Boat restaurant was delicious, with the best fish and prawn curries we had in Kerala. Everything about this hotel was great - thoroughly recommend this place.',pos
'The service at this hotel was consistently extraordinary, while at the same time being incredibly warm and sincere. i have traveled so much for business and I have never been cared for this way before! On check in when I apologized for being a bit tired and spacey and mentioned I had been traveling for 26 hours to get there they immediately gave me my room key and whisked me and my things up to my room. without even giving them a credit card. i came down to check in after a nap. the next morning as I waited for our driver i chatted with one of the front desk staff. he came out a few minute later as we were getting in the car with a throat lozenge. Madame, I noticed that you had coughed a little while we were talking. i thought you might need this. when I got back from a dinner at 10:30 p.m. and said I needed a gift for a client the next morning they immediately opened the gift shop. they never let me carry even my computer bag to my room on my own. (normally this would bug me but they were so kind and gracious that I got spoiled and learned to really appreciate it). lovely view from my room of trees and the pool. amazing amazing breakfast. incredibly friendly dining room staff. cannot wait to go back!Room Tip: the view overlooking the pool was lovely. none of the rooms are safe from the bangalore street nois...See more room tips',pos

'I have a job where I am able to travel frequently and try various hotels, there is one hotel that I always keep coming back to - that is The Oberoi Bangalore! The Oberoi Bangalore is not just a hotel, it is an experience!

Whenever I do have to check out of this experience, I wish I would be able to stay one more day. The service that I always experience is one of kind! The check in process is great and private, which is nice. The restaurants - the Polo Club and the breakfast buffet - are very well kept and the service there is like none other.

'Our second visit in 12 months and it only gets better.We booked direct with the hotel - a sensible option--upon arrival at the airport we were meet by the friendly driver from the Taj who was very helpful ..Soon we were checked into the room that is situated in the original part of the hotel with a view over the water,what a lovely room.Next morning we decided to catch the ferry to the old town ,ferry costs about 5 cents , worth the trip, the hotel insisted that they drive us to the terminal-we could have caught a Tuk Tuk (50 cents) .We hired a Tuk Tuk on the other side for most of the day and saw the sights we missed last year..Food is good while breakfast was in our tariff,as we booked direct we were offered a 20 \% discount on any other meals.Taj staff really go out of the way to make clients happy.Stay here again ? yes of course .',pos

'Immaculate rooms, excellent service, good base for a business traveller. The hotel lobby is a beautiful place to walk through or wait for your morning car. Rooms are immaculate, adequately spacious. I loved sitting on my own balcony, drinking tea and looking out over the beautiful garden. Staff were friendly, addressing me by name after the first day. No problem with eggs and bacon made to order for breakfast followed by porridge, but well worth trying the Indian breakfast with a made to order Dosa and sauce. Door staff are traditionally dressed and immaculately presented, harking back to an earlier age. You also need to handle being saluted by up to half a dozen security staff, simultaneously or consecutively so you need to be sure your post-colonial sensitivities are well programmed against guilt and embarrassment. The different ethnic restaurants were all first rate. The hotel can\'t be responsible for the erratic quality of Indian tv programmes, but they do provide a DVD player.See all photos',pos

'I visited Bangalore for business purposes and stayed at The Oberoi Hotel for 18 nights. The hotel and the staff of the hotel made my stay very enjoyable.The hotel arranged a pick-up from the airport (which is a good 45 min drive from the hotel) which was great. However, the driver was somewhat rude when we tipped him 200 INR and he claimed it was not a very generous tipI was immediately impressed with the very nice lobby. The check-in was very fast and friendly and we were offered a great room at the third floor. The room offered everything you could whish for as a business traveler, even a private steam cubicle and walk-in shower. However, the room smelled a bit damp, but it didnt disturb me too much. I think the pollution in Bangalore has a great deal to do with this. I was also very impressed with the daily cleaning service, every detail was taken care of. I was a little bit afraid of the food hygiene because of all the horror stories you hear from India, but this was never an issue at The Oberoi. The breakfast was very nice, although the service was sometimes a bit slow. On two occasions, the staff even forgot me to bring my orange juice. The hotel has three restaurants (Indian-European, Chinese and Thai) and each of them offers great food in a nice scenery. Especially the Thai (Rim Naam) is worth a visit! If I have to be somewhat critical, I was sometimes annoyed by the marketing managers who approached us during our meal. I think this could be done more discrete.I was also impressed with the very nice garden and pool of the hotel.Again, the hotel offered a free transfer to the airport at the last day. The car itself was clean and well maintained, but the driver drove very fast and dangerous. Maybe its common for Indians, but Europeans are not used to this way of driving. Also, the music in the car was very loud and inappropriate.But all in all, it was a very nice experience and I will not hesitate to book this hotel again when I visit Bangalore!',pos

From the bell staff to the front desk to restaurant staff and everybody in between I had a great experience all around. Rooms are great and breakfast buffet had more than sufficient options. While there\'s not too much to see immediately around the hotel it\'s a nice oasis and reasonable walking distance to some of the shopping areas. Overall I was very impressed with the Oberoi and looking forward to staying at any of their properties in the future.',pos
'I was impressed by the meticulous attention to detail and courtesy that was afforded to the guests. From the moment I walked in at 5 AM, off a flight, I was greeted and offered refreshment before starting the checkin process. As to the aesthetics, the hotel and rooms are gorgeous. The room was spotless, as were all the public areas of the hotel.and everything was laid out with precision. The hotel food was good, and they were extremely accomodating when I asked for small deltas off the menu.This hotel excelled in the little things that truly differentiate. For example, I had forgotten to pack a travel shaving cream. I figured I would order or buy one but had not gotten to it on day one in Bangalore. Housekeeping saw that and the Housekeeping Supervisor himself (Singaravelan J.) knocked on my door the next morning to offer me a new mini-can of Gillette (matching my razor) since it had been noted by housecleaning that I was out, as well as toothpaste since they were concerned that my travel sized toothpaste would not suffice.the only downside to the hotel was the noisy throughfare, which in Bangalore means that horns start blaring by 6 AM. On the bright side, if you closed the inner door to the room entryway, the sound was muffled excellently. It took me the first night to figure that one out.Room Tip: When you come in jet lagged, remember to close the door to the entryway.See more room tips',pos
'A lovely place to stay. Stayed there on a working trip to Cochin. This hotel is a resort , far away from town, go through the entire harbour to reach it! Beautiful old style Malabar building right on the seafront/bay. The rooms are lovely , converted palace style. The whole hotel is calm and tranquill. Wonderful pool, gardens, outdoor grills. Excellent buffet breakfast. Had a great dinner in the restaurant. Very good staff. I love this place, the atmosphere , it\'s really land\'s end (try coming here at 1:00 p.m. in the night like I did and you might see what I mean). Will have to come back with family on a holiday , whatever it takes.Room Tip: I stayed in the old wing and it was charming. Dont know about the new wing.See more room tips',pos
'This is my sixth stay at the Bangalore Oberoi spreading within the last 4 years and everytime I walk out of my stay with satisfaction and an awe for the service standards they set.I stayed for 2 nights in my recent trip and we were picked up at the airport promptly and whisked away to the hotel within 45 mins. We were booked at their standard room and upon checkin, we were upgraded to the next category of room which is always a pleasant surprise upon checkin. The room was very spacious, with good king sized bed (very comfortable for a good night sleep), big sized work table and a nice balcony overlooking the pool. The bathroom againw as spacious with seperate shower and with walk in closet. Overall the room was done in a brilliant manner well suited for a work traveller.I have said this in my previous reviews, that this property is a old property with the building starting to show its age, but they have done good work of covering that up and you don\'t feel much that this is a run down property in any means.They have a decent size pool by the gardens which is a tranquil atmosphere compared to the hectic city life outside. We were by the pool couple of times and the service by the pool is very prompt and great.Overall the service at this Oberoi is quiet good. I have stayed at few other Oberoi properties and other hotel chains and for me those properties can learn a thing or two about service standards from this Oberoi property. Theres not one thing that makes this service staff stand out, its the combination of service staff from the time of check in until check out that makes it stand out. We tried the food at the restaurants and overall the quality of both the Indian and the bar was of quiet good standards. Overall my stay again at the Oberoi Bangalore stood out again and seems to set the standards for the hotels there. Very well done by the management and the staff for keeping those standards consistently.',pos

'Although a little less opulent than some other Tajs, the Taj Malabar is beautiful and comfortable. Our corner room offered a stupendous view and welcome privacy. It was reasonably quiet even when a huge wedding went on just below our window. The staff is ready to address any wish - sometimes before you think of it yourself! I didn\'t tell anyone that my birthday fell during our stay...but someone figured it out. A troupe of eight staff members surprised me with a bouquet of flowers, a (fantastic) chocolate cake, and a guitar serenade! One thing to note: it\'s far from the center of town. A taxi strike (like the one that happened during our stay) may leave you with few options besides lounging at the pool and eating!',pos

'The fine location of this hotel on the sea front would be reason alone to stay here, however it is the staff that made our stay memorable. Without exception they were professional, courteous and friendly without being over familiar. We would especially commend the barman Jaimon, who made our stay over three days all the more enjoyable. The bar and lounge area with lovely sofas and chairs was spotless and very comfortable.At breakfast you would normally expect to queue to have the chef cook fresh eggs.omelettes etc. At the Taj your order is taken by a suited waiter at the egg station and then brought a few minutes later to your table, all without fuss. This is one of the best hotels in which we have stayed anywhere in the world, we particularly enjoyed chartering the hotel\'s own boat, complete with the charming Captain and crew. As it is unlikely we will take a land tour of this region again, we are now searching the cruise lines who visit Cochin, to enable us to stay again at this wonderful hotel.Room Tip: We had a side sea room which was fine, those rooms facing the sea seemed to have large balconies, no...See more room tips',pos

The 2 restaurants offer very nice food and the staff is really friendly.There is also SPA center with swimming pool and sauna as well massage center.I do recomend this hotel if you plan a privat or business trip to Bangalore.',pos
'We have just returned from a two-night stay in interconnecting rooms as a family of 5 (3 young children - aged 6, 6 &amp 8). This hotel is outstanding in all respects. Every member of staff without exception from the security on the hotel gate, the lobby staff, housekeeping, restaurant staff, poolside staff etc.. were incredibly helpful and polite. Nothing was too much trouble and the whole Oberoi Team went out of their way to make our children and us feel like VIPs.The breakfast (we were on a bed and breakfast rate) was amazing and without doubt the best we have had in the World - everything that you could imagine was either available on the buffet or freshly prepared for us by Chef Jaydeep and his team. We also had a lovely dinner for two in the Szechwan Court. We booked the table through Concierge in the afternoon and informed them that our driver would be looking after the children whilst we ate. Before we went down for dinner, a new children\'s DVD that Concierge had been out a bought arrived together with some popcorn. One of many examples over the weekend of the staff going above and beyond what is expected.When we booked, the price was competitive with other 5-star hotels in Bangalore. We are very happy with the value for money.Overall - magnificent hotel with exceptional staff in a great location. If only we could go back tomorrow, we would.',pos
'Ok, So I am not a seasoned traveller and this is my first experience of staying in India and in a hotel of this standard, but I have to say I was over the moon with the standards and the service. The services was perfect, everyone was extremely polite and helpful but not to the extent of getting in the way. The room on the 5th Floor was luxurious and very well maintained, the restaurant food and breaksfast were the best I have had in a hotel ever. I would definitely recommend the Oberoi, Bangalore.',pos
'Choosing this hotel at the end of a month\'s trip was a stroke of luck. An oasis of calm and friendliness with outstanding service it allowed us to rest and prepare for the homeward journey. The staff made us feel at home immediately - of particular note was a waiter in the Thai restaurant who, when we wanted to eat again the same meal we\'d had 2 days earlier, recalled our order perfectly including the wine! What attention, what service.You will be saluted from beginning to end of your stay and we, in turn, salute the Oberoi. Of the 10 hotels we visited, this is the one we\'ll remember.',pos

'Right from the time you check through your entire stay, Ive been thinking whether this is the place I would want to stay everytime Ill visit Bangalore. Such was the experience of my 3 days stay at The Oberoi Bangalore that it left me with no choice what so ever to even think of staying at another hotel.From rooms, to room service, to cuisines, everything seems to be perfect. Early September whan I visited Bangalore, after 13 years city was a changed place. One thing which didnt changed was my perception towards the hospitality that Oberoi delivers. Id never been to Oberoi but have been to many other five star and 7 star hotels around the world. From Taj Mansingh to Palazzo Vegas, I didnt ever imagined Oberoi Bangalore to be in the same league.To my surprise, The Oberoi Bangolore was nothing short of delivering the goods. Id been on a business trip for 3 days but being a foodie I always try out different specialities and to have a Szechwan Court and the Rim naam was the best thing. If you happen to stay there, dont miss the Cantonese specialities at the chineese cuisine Szechwan court and the cashew chicken (I am forgetting the real name) at the Thai cuisine Rim naam. You would love the ambience of the Thai court, especially the enternace, a small cave with water all arounf the dining area.The Polo club offers you one of the best ambience you find in a typical sports bars abroad, add to that a special open outside sitting with a solo guitarist playing and singing reggaes And you coul sit there for hours. The only thing I was wondering there is that they still use mosquito coils to get rid of mosquitos (though there werent any that time around), as that was an open space. The garden area has plenty of space for kids to play and I could see a bunch of them busy in kicking football during early evenings.Rooms are good and the best part is the balcony that you get, which is missing from most of the 5 star or 7 star hotels. Youll love to sip your early morning tea in your private balcony and no where else. I didnt had a chance to check out the spa, but what I heard from one of my americal colleagues is, it was awesome, comparable to spas in Hong Kong. Wed been at Excelsior Hong Kong and could definitely relate to that.Overall, the experience I had during my stay at The Oberoi Bangalore, came as a validation of them getting the best hospitality award for consequitive years (I guess 3 in a row). I would strongly recommend The Oberoi Bangalore for any one for the next time they visit the city.',pos
'this hotel gave us an amazing experience..from our arrival where we were treated like royalty and attended to with warmth and efficiency....the hotel is stunningly beautiful....we also enjoyed all the extra little details in the hospitality, greeted with beads, chocolates on our bed, a little lunch to take with us on our day excursion.....but what topped it off we left our luggage there to do an overnight trip and came back hot, tired and dirty as our boat was without a shower....despite us being there to simply pick up our things and head home on a long journey they offered us a room to refresh, shower and prepare to head back to canada...it was unforgettable! i want to go back...loved it!',pos
'The Oberoi is a an excellent home away from home when traveling to Bangalore. As you pull up to the portico and then head into the gracious and lovely lobby, where you are immediately greeted by the extremely helpful staff, the hubbub of the city is left far behind. However, it is when you leave the lobby and proceed onto the beautiful grounds, that lead to the restaurants, bar and pool, that you realize you\'ve reached a very special destination. The gardens are full of majestic, mature trees and wide expanses of greenery that exude a very welcome air of relaxation.But it is not just the physical aspects of this grand hotel that set it apart. By far the most important component of an enjoyable visit to the hotel is the thought and consideration given to the guest by the staff. From the team at The Polo Club, where one can unwind pre-dinner with the Perfect Manhattan, or any of the fine eateries, your every need is anticipated and cared for.If you happen to use the spa you will find the staff there very competent and the services quite complete. From the Fitness Center to the Spa, you should find something to help work out the kinks of a long flight or long hours at the office.All in all, I look forward to a return to The Oberoi, a very special place.',pos
'As noted, this was my first trip to India and stayed at the Oberoi Bangalore. The room was quite comfortable with several outlets for recharging devices and internet connection available.

'I previously reviewed this hotel very positively in April 2007. Having just completed another long-term stay at Oberoi Bangalore, I am updating my review.Simply put, this has to be one of the most well run, finest hotels in the world as far as service and overall quality goes. I recently received the Conde Nast Top 100 listing and noticed many Oberoi\'s in very top of this list. I expect to see the Oberoi Bangalore appear in the future.One would have to look hard to find any fault with this property. I am an extremely picky global travelor and when paying high rates at hotels, sometimes find that high rates do not necessarily equate to stellar service. Well, while the Oberoi Bangalore is not inexpensive, I feel you get what you pay for in this case.I booked a Deluxe Suite which was nice given my extended stay. In the past I have stayed in one of the Premier Rooms with the steam shower, which is also extremely nice. What distinguishes the Oberoi from other Bangalore hotels is the fine levels of service offered, the cleanliness and upkeep of the property, and the general feeling of safety and security the hotel offers.In addition, the food is absolutely delicious. White glove service is provided in both restaurant and in-room dining options.The Oberois evidently have a very good automated system of learning who their guest are and recording guest preferences. While seemingly unimportant, this service especially for a long-stay type guest is very much appreciated. The room service order takers on the phone would basically ask me if I was having my usual for breakfast and it would arrive within 15 - 20 minutes - so ordering breakfast was an effortless task. And get this, sometimes I would not finish everything on my plate, so they would sometimes call to tell me they noticed this to make sure the food was prepared to my liking.Some other 5-star properties in Bangalore offer more as far as size goes - more restaurants, larger bars, more expansive gardens, etc., but these are all just appearance only type offerings - what really matters is the levels of service and hotel management behind a property and the Oberoi get this right to the point of perfection.Overall, I can recommend this hotel highly over the other 5-star properties in Bangalore, some of which I have stayed at and will never return. India, and Bangalore in general can be challenging at times - one has to be constantly on your toes to compete, live, and work in this city. However, after having stayed at other properties to try them out, I will never do so again as long as the Oberoi Bangalore is available.I also held a quite successful luncheon/banquet at the hotel for employees and important guests. The hotel F&ampB department did an amazing job with this as well.Thanks to all the employees at Oberoi Bangalore who truly made this a most memorable business trip. I might add that Oberoi has an incredible employee development and training program, one that hotels around the world would do well to model after. Employees are assigned to different properties and jobs during their training, moving up through the ranks within Oberoi. So, many employees have also worked at other Oberoi properties and gained valuable experience throughout the hotel chain - although I hesitate to call Oberoi a chainBy the way, you may think with this glowing review that I am affiliated with the hotel in some way - I most definitely am not. I own a business in the U.S. and travel worldwide - so when I find a gem like Oberoi Bangalore, I simply like to let my fellow travelors know about the expeirence.',pos
'From the moment you walk in, the staff at Vivanta by Taj - Malabar, is incredibly helpful. They seem to know what you want, even before you know what it is! From making the check-in process smooth to just making every part of your stay enjoyable, they are always ready to help. Sure, the place is more expensive than others, but it is completely worth the splurge. The afternoon tea with a view of the Arabian Sea, with the paper lanterns delicately adding to the mood (and making you look good in the process), was just delightful. The harbor cruise was fun, and a must so you can see the fishing nets in action at sunset.The food is good, but they definitely tone down the spices on the Indian dishes. So, if you\'re into spicy, you might want to say something about that. They surely would accommodate the request.The spa offers an array of services, but again, as with the food, they seem to have a lighter touch. No worries, Vivanta Spa employees, we can take the real thing!All in all, a fantastic experience we would recommend to everyone!Room Tip: Airport transportation is not included, but they will arrange for it.Try and get a corner room!See more room tips',pos
'We spent three nights at the Taj Malabar Hotel in Cochin as part of a tour of South India with Saga. We reached the Taj Malabar at 1730 and were greeted by a young lady who put a mark on our foreheads, which I gather is a blessing. We sat in the lobby and were each given a nice cold drink and soon we had our keys to room 507 on the fifth floor. What a beautiful room with a view of the backwater. There were two large single beds, not big enough for two, one chair and a chaise longue by the window. There was a large flat screen television with BBC World. The bathroom had a bath and a shower, a picture window to the bedroom and a motorised blind controlled from the bathroom. They provided room shoes and dressing gowns. Tea and coffee making facilities were provided. There were stacks of toiletries. Breakfast was very good apart from the bacon, not good anywhere in India, and the coffee awful. I mentioned this to the waiter and he went and made a French Press full of good filter coffee, which I requested each time after that.Dinner was very good with a buffet of many and varied dishes to tempt the palate, with the exception of fish, which seemed in short supply. At 1715 each day tea, coffee and a selection of cakes and biscuits are provided free of charge then a sunset cruise of the backwaters, also free, which went as far as the Chinese Fishing Nets. It was magical.I discovered to my cost that in Kerala there is a 100\% import tax on all imported spirits so my one glass of Jamesons cost me twice what was on the menu.This is a wonderful hotel but expensive.Room Tip: Go high up as the views of the backwaters are magnificent.See more room tips',pos
'I stayed in Oberoi to meet a VVIP in Bangalore. The harmony and the hospitality that I felt during the time is truly world class. Every employee in the hotel made me feel like a king, I have got such royal treat from the employees. I had a small issue during the stay. As soon as the GM got to know about it, she send AM to me and resolved the issue ASAP. I was admired by their response. Liked &#x2014 HarmonyDisliked &#x2014 Nil',pos
'I had a terrific experience at The Oberoi Bangalore. I usually choose this hotel as a business traveler for its convenience and location but this month I stayed at the hotel for 3 days although initially I was scheduled to stay at the hotel for 2 days but my experience was so good that the i did not feel like leaving the hotel premises. I must say I am a difficult person to please but i was so pampered by the hotel that I found it tough to go back home. The extra effort to ensure that my breakfast was served in-room at no extra charge was very convenient as I find it difficult to walk upto the lobby early in the morning. Given the track record of the earlier general mangers, I have a theory that those who get this hot seat at The Oberoi Bangalore are slated for greater glory in the Oberoi empire. By this standard Huvida Marshall who runs a tight ship with a gentle hand is going places. When she first took over I had strong reservations but she has pulled together a team that delights in making a guest feel very special. She has delivered a hotel that embodies the owner who leaves you with a lingering memory of an overwhelming experience.Let me start by stating that Oberoi has excellent service. I arrived late in the evening at 9.30 P.M with an advance reservation on the phone, as I had a few business meetings. There were no problems with check in, and bharat ( I think, who checked me in on my previous stay and remembered me ) was about to escort me to my room but nilesh quickly intervened and within just a few seconds I was whisked away to my room. Nilesh is the hotels F &amp B Manager and the reason he offered to show me to my room instead of the front desk staff who usually escort the guests to their room is because when I did make the reservation on the phone I mentioned the fact that the on my previous stay the quality and taste of the food served both in-room and at the restaurants was not that good although the service was very good.The Premier room was spacious and very well appointed. Had a huge walk in closet (who travels with that much stuff?), DVD player in the room, and a bowl of fresh mangoes on the table. Top quality room (one full bathroom, and very large - would be more than adequate for two adults), and no street noise was audible from the room, the bedroom was well insulated and hence there was no noise at all. A short while after arrival, a floor butler appeared and introduced himself. I couldn\'t think of anything I\'d ask a floor butler to do, but felt special to have one. The grounds are very clean, very quiet and very relaxing in the heart of a busy city.The service at the Oberoi is the best matched only by the Taj in india and the hotel staff made me feel like royalty as it feels odd to have the staff jump up, bow, and how do you do sir? every time you enter a room or walk past I sometimes felt if I indeed deserved that kinda service but I wasnt complaining as it felt pretty damn good infact it was overwhelming. The internet charges are high and the wifi connection was intermitant perhaps the only downside of my stay but then again they made it up by not charging me for wifi. I particularly enjoyed the Chinese and the buffet at le jardin and nilesh and his team pulled a brilliant show, and the fresh fruit and snacks left in our room each day. There was also a decent selection of DVDs available at the front desk. The fitness center with steam room and sauna was nice allthough it wouldve been nice to have a Jacuzzi aswell.As others have mentioned, the staff really did make an effort to know us and our preferences (such as how i like my meals (non-spicy,low-fat and less salt) prepared, my favourite type of fruit platter for breakfast, etc), and brought me a lovely fruit platter of watermelons and papaya and the idlis and the black tea served in-room not to forget the rasmalai all compliments of the chef and I enjoyed it on the comforts of my bed.The beds, linens and pillows were luxurious and comfortable. The king bed was one of the most biggest and the cosiest bed ever I had slept in and because I was travelling I had this big luxurious bed all to myself and it felt like heaven every time I was on the bed. If you stay at he Oberoi make sure to request a room away from MG Road. It will make your stay much quieter. On my next trip to Bangalore I am enthusiastic about my stay at the Oberoi as I am sick and tired of the Leela Palace after just a couple stays. That place is huge and rather impersonal. Had some problems with the room and the shower both times.Overall -- highly recommended,I found the property to be beautiful and the service to be excellent! It provided a relaxing oasis from the crowded city after crazy days of commuting to work and touring.A week later I receive a mail from the management team of the hotel, which was a nice surprise and proof of the fact that the HEROES of this hotel truly and genuinely care about their guests although I am used to such mails from the taj. The team was just following up on the comments card I had filled up and had thanked me for my valuable comments and wanted to know if there is anything that they can do to make my future stays better which is just another example of their undying humility and sincerity with which they look after their guests. Take a bow The Oberoi Bangalore BRAVO!!!',pos

'I have stayed at the Taj Malabar before, however this time was even better....on arrival, we were greeted by a young responsive attentive guest liason person...who informed us that we were being upgraded to a suite...i was so delighted at my room, it was a mini flat...shame it was only for 1 night. However, i made the best use of the room as possible including the four poster bed! The service at the hotel was impeccable...as it is now a Vivanta graded hotel it certainly has re-trained its staff and the younger members of staff are definately more enthuisatic. The sunset cruise which is complimentary is just the icing of a perfect evening with dolphins in sight...it just makes you go aaaah! Other hotels of large chains that charge extortianate prices for low quality service, need to send their staff here so that they can learn what service and quality means to the paying guest. i recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Kerala, even one night is worth it. the cocktails in the bar are excellent. The spa is always relaxing and a must.Room Tip: Heritage room with sunset views are always a must to appreciate the location of the hotelSee more room tips',pos

'Beautiful and elegant hotel, exceptional service. We loved the pool and the bar- the ambience is so relaxed that it\'s so easy to meet and talk to other tourists.

'From the first moment you enter this property, you know, you made the best choice. Even if Oberoi is quite expensive, it is definately worth the money. To maintain your privacy, check-in formalities take place in your room.All rooms have a small balcony facing the pool area. The bathroom has a separate shower and is spacious. Amenities are according to international five star hotels.Several restaurants indoor and alfresco (indoor: don\'t forget to bring a shawl or pullover...). Buffet breakfast in a nice atmosphere: fresh juices, fruits, joghurts but also various breads, salmon and of course the Indian delicacies. Sightseeing not very close by. There is no wish the staff is not immediately willing to fulfill. Information on flights, sightseeing possibilities etc. are provided at any time - be it in the morning or the night. Overall service top notch.',pos
'We stayed at the Vivanta by Taj for in Cochin for 5 days in February of this year 2012. It was our first visit to Cochin and we were so glad to have chosen this highly recommended hotel. The welcome was extremely warm and friendly. Tha service was above expectation. The staff could not do enough to please us, even to the extent of sending flowers to one of the party who was unwell, and seeking out remedies to help. The decor is classy. The level of cleanliness superior, and the free treats (e.g . complimentary tea daily on a terrace overlooking the bay, cruise around the bay, chocolates and information leaflet placed on bed nightly,watermelon slices brought round to guests at poolside, and even a face spritzing service and cool herbal towels for guests sunbathing! ) Buffet food was excellent. The buffet breakfast and dishes to order had a great variety of choice and was very good value for money. We would not choose to stay anywhere else in Cochin.Room Tip: we stayed in a room overlooking the herb garden at the front of the hotel and it proved to be very q...See more room tips',pos
'Everything perfect at this property. I had come on a business trip and refused to go out for business meetings.... my 3rd trip over last 6 years. hope to back very soon.

Its the best place for sea food lovers- Swim pool: facing the sea (infinity pool). - Extras: Hotel provides complimentary evening boat ride in the harbour and complimentary evening tea and snacks (nice touch!!)Room Tip: Choose a room facing the harbour.See more room tips',pos
'The Oberoi Hotel is unquestionably the most exciting hotel in whole of Bangalore and no place puts visitors in closer proximity to everything there is to see than the The Oberoi Hotel. A 5 Star Deluxe with excellent service. I\'ve stayed in this hotel for a period of 3 days on my business trip and was accompanied with one of our clients. While entering I felt a little hesitant, but it was completely surprised by the quality of services we were offered. With Doctor on Call,Travel Desk Service and Safe Deposit, I was certainly what I didn\'t expect. If someone asked me to rate this hotel on a scale of 5, I would have definitely given 5 for the services provided.',pos
'This is by far the best hotel we have stayed at in India.The setting is beautiful and the Sunset cruise is a must to do.Great choice of food and great staff',pos
'As the hotel we stayed in for the last 3 days of our Honeymoon, it really was an excellent choice to make. We got married in Pune, India, so took our honeymoon in Kerela split between this Vivanta and the one in Kovalam (See our other review for that one.)The Kovalam hotel phoned ahead and informed the Malabar that we were on our honeymoon. The treatment/service we experienced was fantastic. However only bad thing I did find was when the girl showing us to our room stated \'we have upgraded you becasue you are on your honeymoon\' and actually it was the suite we had already booked. It was kind of like she assumed we would never have paid for that suite ourselves! It was the second most luxurious one in the place but still... Ouch! That aside the staff really were fantastic. Little treats and things to celebrate our honeymoon. (See photos)Food was lovely. It was nice to eat in the Thai restaurant as having been in India for 3 weeks we were stuffed to the brim with Indian food! It was delicous. We ate in another restaruant the following night and the waiter/chef who served us told me he could make me whatever I wanted as I faniced something that they didnt serve on the menu. Fantastic! Was really yummy too. Each morning we had an excursion and never took breakfast as it was too early... And each morning the conceirge ran after us with boxes of food to eat on the way! Lovely man.I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone. The food was great, the hotel was beautiful. The pool was really nice (little chilly) as was the poolside bar. However, it is the service that sells the place. For example we ordered room service one night after a tiring day and they bought a whole table and set it up for us in our living room! Crazy but really nice.*A must do is the elephant training camp where you can watch the hefalumps bathe. Lovely exerience.',pos
'Stayed here on our arrival into Banagalore from London and would recommend it for your overnight stay. We arrived at 07:30 in the morning and we were offered immediate checkin. A small breakfast was provided in our room and we were also able to take our breakfast from the following morning at 10:00 on the morning of our arrival. (we were leaving to go back to the airport at 04:00 so were not able to take breakfast on our departure date). We had dinner in the Thai Restaurant which was excellent.As always the Oberio deliver a quality service.',pos
'This is possibly one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in - every detail was thought of.All the staff were very friendly and helpful, from an early morning arrival to another early morning departure (3am) where they had a small breakfast waiting for me to eat on the way to the airport. I was really impressed with every small detail, even down to a pre-completed departure card awaiting me on check out.I stayed for 2 weeks so was lucky enough to sample the food at all the onsite restaurants - I normally don\'t eat in hotels whilst away, but can honestly say that the food at each of the Oberoi\'s restaurants is not to be missed.Would 100\% recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Bangalore and will definitely return again. Thanks to all the staff for making my stay so enjoyable!',pos
'Well maintained. Courteous &amp Prompt service. Excellent hotel.',pos
'Sorry for the extremely late review. Visited the hotel in September 2010. Did not stay here but the service at the Chinese restaurant was fabulous- the type one has begun to expect from Oberoi hotels. The manager- Marcia Barlow was most hospitable and decided to host us even when the restaurant was 2 minutes from closing. We stayed at the Taj west end which was a complete disappointment. Next time at the TOBL for sure. Thank you for the most amazing lunch.',pos
