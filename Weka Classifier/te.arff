'The room looks at first very impressively designed, but once you start actually using it, you notice the functional flaws: The desk chair is rather uncomfortable, and mine tended to lose height adjustment over time. Wireless LAN is very slow (despite being pretty expensive on top of the already expensive room price). There are lots of light switches around the bed, which operate weird combinations of lights, but I couldn\'t find one that would actually only operate the bedside lamps. Beyond the functionality, also the execution of the building work is surprisingly shoddy and in strong contrast with the high-class design impression they try to convey, e.g. careless paint jobs and fixtures (e.g. mirror, sink) that are not properly aligned. The reception staff is unfriendly and doesn\'t exchange information very well. If you reach agreement with one of their front desk people that\'s not enough to settle an issue. Housekeeping is better in remembering special wishes.Overall, the hotel is OK and tolerable for a few days, but definitely not up to the expectations raised by prices and design. I have had much better experiences at other hotels in Bangalore.',neg
'I have been to hotels world wide and have never been so embarrassed.We were in pune for a wedding and hence were dressed in formal Indian outfits.We had friends from US and UK who were also dressed in formal Indian clothes.We were denied entry to their disco/pub called scream only on the basis of our attire, while we saw students entering the same place in flip-flops.where in the world our people denied entry just because they are wearing their national clothes.I will never evr step into the hotel and so are my 15 friends who were there that night. I hate this hotel staff completely. they discriminate a lot.',neg
'At the first glance, this hotel looks very nice. However, as soon as one looks at all the details which make a hotel stay a real luxury experience, the stay at Suryagarh turns out to be a nightmare.The quality of food was very poor (our only food poisoning during our 3 weeks holiday in Rajasthan).The rooms are not soundproof at all - you can hear everything your neighbour is doing or saying. The quality of materials used for decoration is poor - everything looks like a decor in a bad Bollywood movie.There were construction works ongoing just in front of our window, causing a lot of dust and noise.The hotel is far away from the city center, and is located in the middle of nowhere.',neg
'To say this is a 5 star Hotel should not only depend on the hotel and facilities but should also focus on service, to which there is none. If you are considering traveling to this hotel you should make sure that you do not stay over the holiday periods as they also use the hotel as a wedding venue for very large weddings and therefore any holiday guests that are staying are in the minority. During our 8 day stay the hotel was taken over by 3-400 wedding guests for six different weddings. On each occasion parts of the hotel are shut off to holiday guests such as one of the pools and one or two of the restaurant\'s depending on what time of the day it is.  We had to move rooms on four occasions depending on what part of the Hotel had been hired out for the wedding as this changed from the bar to the main pool then to the lawn area or maybe all three areas at different times of the day. I have been travelling to many different countries over the years and I have never experienced such a terrible mistreatment of hotel guests I think I can speak on behalf of the very few guests that were staying there at the same time as us by saying we all felt that we were treated like 2nd class citizens and that the wedding guests were the most important people to the Hotel. Do not spend your hard earned money staying here find somewhere that is actually a 5 star as this resort is not!  Room Tip: Choose the diwa wingSee more room tips',neg
'We stayed here during the good friday long weekend and the resort was packed. Seems to have become extremely popular and talked about in the past year or do. I really don\'t know why?The goods things first: The property is well laid out, not too big not to small. Its got a shuttle access to the beach which is convenient. Its close to the airport, about 20 mins. We had a really good time with the kids. The kiddy pool is nice and so is the children\'s center. The activities organised for the kids on Easter Sunday was fun. The staff at the childrens center was helpful. The pool looked nice and comfortable lazy benches in the pool to lie inside. Now for the real deal: Honestly for a 5 star property with a 5 star price its nowhere close. The rooms though spacious are not squeeky clean. We had a garden room the flooring tiles seemed to have some portion chipped off and the table in the room was not fully polished. The big bathtub in the bathroom (with the sliding door) seemed more like a hindrance rather than a comfort. The pool corners had dirt and goo accumulated. Saw that when my sister pointed it out, not a very pleasant sight. The worst part was the service and food. We had taken an all meals including package and maybe that was a big mistake as the food spread though large was poor in taste. Only saving grace was the dosa during breakfast which was exceptionally good. The service was appalling at the dining area. Seems like no one cares, everyone is running around like chickens with their heads cut off. When asked to do anything it takes forever and umpteen reminders. Really poor. Also the room service ordered for kids food takes forever to deliver and when asked to make it less spicy, it doesnt\' happen that way. I cant understand how can they mess it up. The staff at the reception also painfully slow. Despite informing them well in advance they couldn\'t organise an airport drop off in time at 3 pm. It took forever to get a few cars in place. I find it hard to believe how difficult can that be. Our family was big with many children and we had fun, but I would not recommend this place to anyone with 5 star expectation. I have stayed at the Taj Village in Goa (see my other review) and believe me this is nowhere close. Service in a 5 star is top notch and sorry to say but Alila Diwa Goa has a long way to go. Glad that i will never be back here again.',neg

'When we went through the reviews it seemed to be the best choice to be made in and around the Hijewadi area. But once we reached the hotel the disaster started. Firstly, inspite of booking the property online, I was greeted by a staff with a feedback that I have booking in a different property. When I showed him my voucher he made some calls and then after 10 minutes confirmed that we are in the right place. There was a specific request put in by me while booking for an early check in which obviously did not happen and we waited for about 20 minutes to get into the room. The rooms are quite big and spacious with good furniture. But the surprising part was that it was awfully mainatined. The bed rest had spunges coming out of it. The tap did not have a free water flow. The curtains were dirty. The railing of the verandah were filthy with a lot of dirt. The bathroom though big had very small enclosures for bath and toilet. The good part was that the room had 2 televsions. There was a leakage in the bathroom also where the water was dropping from the ceiling. The most awful part was the breakfast spread which was one of the worst I had till date. Overall a bad experience. You have better hotels around.Room Tip: Dont know since the rooms seemed to be of the same pattern. You have lot of better options around...See more room tips',neg

But, as I was relaxing in my room waiting to head to the airport and come back to the states, I noticed a very large mouse was running around my room. I was totally surprised to see such rodent in what seemed a pristine room. I immediately grabbed my things and checked out a bit early.

'My family and I had been planning my grandmother\'s 82nd birthday celebration for months. We finally decided on Bahia Marina. There were 7 of us and one of our rooms was not ready yet. The first thing we did when we arrived was take my grandmother to her room to get her situated. When we entered the room, the floor was soaking wet. The employee said that it must be wet because they just mopped. That was not the case....... Water was dripping from the ceiling onto the tile floor, making it extremely slippery!!! Not ideal for an 82 year old woman to walk around on. The ceiling in the bedroom was also leaking.....all over the beds. You would think they would apologize or in the least offer to get us a new room. We actually had to ask them to move us (so that my grandmother would not have to sleep on a wet bed). Cleanliness:The bathrooms looked dirty. The tiled floor had grime buildup and the toilets and sinks could use a good scrub. While laying in the uncomfortable beds, you had to stare up at a stained and peeling ceiling. The rooms were NOT cleaned while we were there. Our choices were to either sweep and clean the room ourselves, or stay in a dirty room. We chose to clean it ourselves. Also, there were 4 people in our room and we were only given 2 towels.....did they think we were going to share bath towels??? Food:The food was extremely overpriced (between 24-32 dollars a plate). For that much money, I would expect a great meal. My mother and I decided to share the meal to cut down on cost. is not what we got. We ordered the Mofongo w/ churrasco. Mofongo is a typical Puerto Rican dish made from fried mashed plantains. The waitress said they were out of plantains, but made a Mofongo out of yuca (root veg.). What I was served was a ball of tasteless yuca in the form of mashed potatoes that had absolutely NO FLAVOR. The meat was INEDIBLE....tough and tasted horrible. Others at my table tasted it an agreed. I wasn\'t going to say anything to the staff, but the waitress asked. She wanted to know why we did not the meal. When we expressed our dissatisfaction with the meal, she just shrugged it off and walked away. When we got the bill, the horrible uneaten meal was not taken off. We had to pay for bad food we could not eat!Rooms:Not enough towels, Not cleaned daily, Uncomfortable beds and HORRIBLE futon, NO iron, No hair dryer...At least there was HBO to have something to look at other than all the room flaws!Staff:The staff was friendly.',neg

'I would give Alila Goa the hotel and it\'s staff five stars but.....an otherwise amazing hotel experience has been marred by hordes of extremely loud Indian wedding celebrations. I have never been to a beach holiday that was as untranquil as this one. My first impression was wow and Until our last day I thought that the management sort of tried to keep the full paying hotel guests a little shielded, but on our last day at breakfast it was like a fish market with incredibly loud drums and shouting all over the place. In front of our amazing room were Indian guests shouting from one end of the corridor to the other. This hotel is truly paradise if not for the management allowing such behavior and noise.Thank you though to the exceptional restaurant and pool staff.',neg
'Soul vacation is very mediocre and the hotel looks tired. The rooms were spacious but not very clean. The restaurant was really unclean. The rating three star is not based on cleanliness and general upkeep. Don\'t let the snazzy website get your hopes up. The area was ridden with malaria and chikungunya while we were there. One tour guide told us almost everbody in the town of Colva had gotten malaria. I am ashamed as an Indian to potray Goa as a beach resort to foreigners visting India. It is one of the dirtiest cities in India...and I am from Mumbai. Goa overall was dissapointing. If you want a beach go to Kerala. Despite all that the overall service was good.Liked &#x2014 the massage parlorDisliked &#x2014 lack of cleanlioness',neg
'The hotel was previously owned by the government and the new management that has taken over has done little to change that perception. The hotel has been renovated, but unfortunately the staff are either not equipped or cannot handle even basis and simple requests. We had organized a group to stay here and from the airport transfer to the hall and the meals, everything was a disaster. The transfers were missed in spite of reconfirming with the hotel twice. The Banquet halls which were specifically asked to be blocked were given to someone else and we were asked to move to another hall. The food being served, with specific instruction about dietary restrictions were not followed. The hall set up on both the days had to be done by my colleagues and myself with no one from the staff helping us. Despite trying to reach any of the staff, the response were pathetic. Everyone seems to be passing the buck to someone else and no one wants to take responsibility or care for guests.The GM of the property, who met us on arrival and made us a lot of promises, couldn\'t be reached for anything. This is after he telling us that he is reachable at any time. He was always stuck in some meetings and on calls and after trying to reach him thrice, I just gave up. No wonder his staff cares 2 damn hoots about the guests. The service at their coffee shop (24/7) was a joke and even after being seated at the time for 10 mins, no water was served.The only saving grace for this property are the their speciality restaurants. One serves amazing Indian foods and the other specializes in Pan Asian food.This property is just not worth it and I hope anyone travelling to Bangalore and planning to stay there would prefer going down the road to many more properties that offer better services, are more attentive to guests needs and are priced on par and even lesser than this property.My advise, unless you are ok with putting up with mediocre (Bordering on Pathetic) service, swipe your card someplace else and not in this hotel.',neg
'First thing first... I am really wondering why this hotel has such a wonderful reviews in Trip advisor and other travel website. And these reviews on trip advisor motivated me to select this hotel.Location of this hotel (Soul Vacation) is near Colva beach, which is located in Southern part of Goa. And almost most of the happening and fun beaches are located in North Goa. So you can enjoy beach (Colva) near this hotel for one day almost.. Morning, evening and next day morning but then you have to travel to other places. We had to travel a lot ..:( and will coming back its late in night, which is not good for a new city.Let me explain a brief about Goa, it is basically divided into three part ..North Goa, which has good and happening beaches and most of beaches are located here.. Then Panaji, this is central part and it mid way between North and South Goa capital of Goa , most of Churches are located here and Ferry is here. And then South Goa, not many beaches are there..in fact there are only two beaches but the main railway station, Margoa is here and it is abt 3-5 km from this hotel. I will recommend location to stay in Goa near to Calangute - Baga beach or Panjim (panaji).We had opted for Candle light dinner after going through there impressive website I must say their website is very fancy and multimedia rich. But the way they serve food and menu was not very good. Menu was very very limited in Offering and they call it complimentary dinner and everything is way away from a romantic thing. Housekeeping is good. Internet is very very expensive abt 125 INR(3$) per hour. And there is no much difference between standard and deluxe room. Manager name is Durav.We felt this hotel to be expensive when compared to most of other hotels in Goa.Considering all this I feel hotel NOT recommend.',neg
'We have experienced the worst service ever at the Italian Restaurant. A lot of attitude by one of the Hostess, when we asked for the menu actually gave it to us by saying \'\' Here Take\'\'.We packed up some food where the pizza box was just put on our table half open.Completely disgusted and will never visit this place again.',neg
'First, the GOODGREAT view from the room, room amenities are first world, staff are polite, futon sofa is comfortable to sit on, two bathrooms in a one bedroom is pretty sweet--we used one for the baby\'s portable crib so she could be in darkness at night. The kitchen has a full fridge, a big microwave, and a two plate stove--enough to be able to cook meals easily. Flamenco Beach--superb! Rent a car and bring it over to the island--it\'s much cheaper than renting on the island.Next, the BADIf you have an immediate problem that can quickly be solved, they\'ll help you. We asked for a tablecloth to make our table look special one night--they brought one right over. If it\'s a more serious problem that can\'t be dealt with immediately, well, it didn\'t get dealt with at all. See below--the UGLY section.The mosquitos--we went in the Dec-Jan. season and the mosquitos were a problem, but apparently this is nothing compared to the summer season. Wear repellent, especially if you\'re near the check in area.One check-in staff member says there\'s no laundry facilities and points out on a map where to go to get laundry done. Days later, another staff member explains, no, you can get it done here but only between certain hours when they\'re not using the machines.The whirlpool doesn\'t function--it\'s just the regular pool temperature water.The UGLYThe staff, as nice as they are, well you judge:I was supposed to be picked up from the ferry (it\'s an amenity they provide). I called to let them know I arrived as they ask you to do. 45 minutes later, I call them and ask where my ride is. I\'m told he\'s leaving now. When I ask the driver how long he\'s been waiting around the Bahia Marina, he tells me 20 minutes. She didn\'t relay the message--and if I hadn\'t called, I\'d still be waiting there for him.My family needed to catch the ferry at 6:30am on a Sunday. He we go again. I made it clear to the checkout person it was imperative that we make that ferry so that we can catch our flight back to Toronto. She called the driver in front of me. Because of previous problems with the staff, I asked for the driver\'s phone number. She gave it to me, but explained, he picks me up every morning. He\'s very reliable. 6:00am comes and goes and no ride. The driver isn\'t answering his phone. The binder they provide in the suites gives NO emergency number and NO land taxi number. We miss our 6:30am ferry. Finally, the regular driver shows up and explains the driver they got me was a taxi driver they use regularly when the pickup/drop off happens outside the regular driver\'s hours. Long story short, we ended up chartering a flight for $400 USD (and get a taxi $12USD to the ferry parking lot) as no regular flights had space before and the resident manager refused to take responsibility and pay for it. He said it\'s the taxi driver\'s fault. Excuse me, but didn\'t you call a taxi on behalf of the Bahia Marina to fulfill the amenity of free pick-up and drop off? Wasn\'t I promised by your employee at the front desk taht there\'d be no problem? Eventually, after SEVERAL follow-up calls to avery friendly but not so reliable reservation agent, the top manager was willing to refund the $400USD and when I asked to have it placed on my credit card so the money would help pay my bills before the statement due date, they subtracted 4\% for credit card fees. I\'ll never see the $12USD for the taxi or $12USD for the fees and I\'m pleased to be getting most of it back considering the service I got from them--there\'s so much more.The cleaning service--they will take out your garbage and usually make the beds--that\'s all? Yup--that is what their binder in each room refers to as regular service. If you want towel service, you need to put the towels in the bin they provide. If you want counters, tables, etc. cleaned, you have to chase them down. The manager of the cleaning staff says it\'s hard to get professional help on the island. This is her excuse. The toilet was filthy for DAYS and we finally got them to clean it after chasing them down, as well as cleaning the kitchen table.We reported the first or second day that there was a strong wind blowing between the two glass balcony doors that made it sound as though we were having a thunder storm outside CONSTANTLY. The resident manger said he\'d get it looked at and fixed. NEVER HAPPENED.',neg
'in this beatifull resort, the management locked the nice central pool for a wedding parry, not allowing any other of the guests to swim . it seems that a weddingparty is more important to te manager than his guests. after complaining , nothing changed , and the normal guests were not taken seriously. i have never seen something happening like this in a 5 star resort.',neg

'I stayed here for my final 2 nights in Bangalore after a 4 month business trip - we chose it for its proximity to the airport and because the Taj West End was full :-(It isn\'t the prettiest hotel but it is functional and the pool and gym are pretty good. The room (we had a suite) was a good size but smelt musty especially in the bathroom as if damp towels had been left in there for a few days.The real problem lies in the service in the 24/7 Cafe - it was nothing short of awful. You suffer the usual invisibility challenge that seems to have beset Bangalore hotels in the last year or so but then the speed of service gets worse. We ordered some drinks and some pasta for the 2 boys (both under 4), after prompting them after 20 minutes or so I got a beer but the orange juice was still en route from California I presume.Eventually, 30 mins plus the pasta arrived and was ferociously spicy - no joy for the kids, so back it went. Finally the pasta arrived and we fed two (now raging) young boys. We never saw the other dishes we ordered but thankfully didn\'t pay for them either.Breakfast on day 2 was more of the same, we were once again wearing our cloaks of invisibility and the general feel was one of damn these demanding customers, don\'t they see we are busy. The buffet was average at best and the tea (one of my personal markers of quality) was foul.Would I stay again, not whilst the sun comes up. I\'m sure if you are a conference delegate or similar than the hotel probably does a passable job, but compared to the other options in Bangalore - Oberoi, Taj (x3), Ista, etc etc it is very second tier.',neg
'We booked a 4 star trip around India, concluding with a stay in what looked like (if you believe the website) an idillic retreat with great service, facilities and accomodation. What we found when we arrived is still shocking...the entrance is the start, poorly maintained but laughably has a sign quoting their 30 luxuary rooms. When we were taken to our room, a deluxe room, the interior was anything but stylish. The furniture and room fitting are old, painted a dirty cream (not white), the bathroom was small, poorly lit, the shower was covered in mould, the sink and toilet surround stained, plugs not fitted to the wall, towels stained and worn...the bed linen was as bad, we had them change the entire bedding before we\'d go near it. The first morning we\'d hoped for improvement but the rest of the hotel was unfortunately no better, the pool was dirty and was stained green, it had tiles broken throughout with loose tiles lying on the bottom of the pool (and a printed sign saying they couldn\'t do the maintenance as it was the sesson and they\'d need 9 days to complete the repairs), the bar had dirty cushions and was covered in brown stains, the breakfast food was appauling, the service even worse...we eventually after much chasing and battling with our travel company left after three horrible nights...if you think I\'m being extreme then please do look at my photos before you book this hotel.',neg
'This hotel has an overall good look on the outside but is poorly done on the inside. The bathrooms have a perpetual sewer stench.

'First the good points: great views, friendly locals who work at the place, the pick up from the airport, and excellent ceviche. But oh dear lord: the roaches the flooding through the doors, windows and patio door the paper-thin walls the smell of mildew the denial of some of the workers that anything was the matter with the rooms and the coral reefs (they\'re terribly bleached and threatened with over fishing, and the garbage left on all the beaches or spilling out of the landfill at Tamarindo beach was depressing-- and yet, the staff insisted the islanders were environmentally aware). In short, do not stay here. And if you\'re a snorkeler coming to Culebra, bring your anti-depressants and stay down the road at Club Seaborne.',neg
'Excellent pizza to be fair. Otherwise this place is ridculously conceived. Why put a restaurant in a space you could comfortably park a 747? Worse still, the AC is so fierce diners are besrt advised to wear thermals and/or a fur coat, if their ethics allow. We asked the staff to turn it down, which they said they did, but the space is so cavernous, we\'d probably need to have waited till midnight to notice the effect. Further negative is that the table was too high for the seating. I felt like asking for a high chair. I sent back the mushroom risotto as it was way oversalted. The chef came out to do his tour of the tables and apologised and said it was down to the parmesan cheese being salty but in a place charging 5 star prices, I expect the cook to taste the food to check the seasoning. To cap a disappointing evening the grappa I requested was billed as large, even though I ordered a single. This is an irritating trend in restaurants in India. I insisted they remove 650 rupees from the bill, which they did. Staff friendly and helpful but this restaurant is not up to standard.',neg
'While I understand that this place is in a remote setting I was disappointed in the hotel. Room smelled musty and sheets and towels were quite rough. Came into the room and the AC had not even been turned on. Took a long time to cool the room down. Pool area was nice. Lack of breakfast and lunch is a big negative. At the very least they should have some kind of small convenience store or vending machine. While these were issues, my biggest complaint is a charge to my credit card that I did not make. When trying to get this issue resolved the hotel staff was not helpful at all and could not effectively look up my records. I had to call multiple times to even talk to someone and in the end had to contact my credit card company directly to properly address the issue.',neg
'Nice hotel on the outside but terrible once you check in. The staff is rude and most unwilling to help!

'For those who have enjoyed Taj Hospitality would experience some far less ordinary from the Taj Blue Diamond. It was fairly late about past midnight when I arrived for my check in, while I had booked for a non smoking, King Bed, that wasnt available and to make things worse it was on the smoking floor. Whats worse about the 1st Floor is that this is the floor that is yet to be renovated, the furniture is mica laminated and the room has a really bulky 25\' TV is placed on dresser, the mattress was hard, the telephone keys had faded beyond recognition. A room of this sort should be about $ 40 (Rs.2000) /night. Anyways I was too tired to go find another hotel given that it was already late. I was booked for 2 nights, but decided to check out the following morning. The duty manager offered another room on a renovated floor, king size, non smoking. I moved to the new room on the 4th floor, which was closer to what you should be accustomed from the Taj. If you\'re getting to the Taj Blue Diamond, be double sure that you\'re on the new floors.Overall: Poor hotel, but a helpful and efficient staff that does its best to make up for what the product lacks. Taj would be better off not offering the first floor to its customers, it seriously impairs their brand image and what they have stood to build over all these years.',neg

'I had stayed in this hotel sometime back. I must say that after the renovation the hotel has got a new and fresh look but absolutely pathetic staff. The Coffee Shop experience is fantastic. Look out for their Manager Ganesh. I guess he has the most warm and best smile in the world. Absolutely fantastic. The rooms are ok, for one night. The walls are too thin and you can almost hear the guy next door snoring. The housekeeping staff is friendly. Now comes the worst part of the hotel that completely ruined my experience and the efforts of all other staff. The Reception!!! I mean what\'s wrong with these guys. The employees can barely communicate in English. My driver can speak better English than any of the reception staff. I had a problem with my car booking which was confirmed by me almost 8 hours prior. When i came for checking out the staff did not have a clue about the booking. When i showed my dissatisfaction a fat fair looking lady who is supposed to be the Duty Manager approached me and tried to apologies in her absolutely ridiculous and broken English and I could not make out anything from the conversation. Finally i had to speak to her Hindi and explain my concern to her. I thought that at least Taj should employ such staff who are professional and have good communication skills. I don\'t know how do they communicate with foreigners. After that lady went a short fat looking man came to further increase my pain. He said that he is the Manager. Although he did not look like one from any angle and on top of that he was show casing the love bite on his neck as he has won some award . He was extremely rude and stressed on the fact that the car problem is mine and not his. He also went ahead and tried to gift me something so that I forget about my problem. How can a gift or anything complimentary solve my problem!!! This is absolutely ridiculous. On top of that he told me to mark him excellent on some online form. Well forget about excellent, if there was something below poor i would give you that. His English was worse than his junior\'s. I would like to ask the General Manager, how can you hire such staff. I have visited other Taj properties and many other hotels worldwide, but the quality of your reception staff in this hotel is extremely bad. The Duty Manager is supposed to be the face of the hotel and over here we have some illiterate girl doing the task and that too in the most unprofessional manner. The staff who was preparing my bills was totally confused when asked about the taxes. I did not want to speak to that fat lady anymore and hence silently settle my bills and lest in complete disgust. I would request all the members to be extremely careful at this particular place because the staff is highly irresponsible and absolutely useless.Please do something about this because it tends to ruin the efforts being put in by the other staff of the hotel.',neg

In the latter category I\'d put virtually all my dealings with the front desk. The driver assigned to pick me up at the airport failed to show, and when I called (late at night, when the town was cold and windy) I was initially told simply to wait 30 minutes because the car had broken down. File that under not my problem. When I pushed the problem to management, they responded quickly, getting a replacement car to me in less than ten minutes, and made a much appreciated effort to apologise for this lapse. I was ready to forgive and forget, but I then faced problem after problem with front desk staff who simply didn\'t seem to understand the level of service expected at a hotel striving for five stars. For example, when I went to arrange my car back to the airport a full day before my departure, I was given many options (wake up call, breakfast box etc), all of which was scribbled out on a scrap of paper in front of me...not very reassuring. At the end of this the clerk asked, as if the thought had just struck him, if I also wanted a car to take me to the airport...kind of the point, as I had made clear. We then had another five minutes where I repeated the same information, i.e. the wake up call, the pick up time, the breakfast box. I asked him to confirm all this to me by email when, six hours later, there was still no email, I had to contact the managers again - again I was reassured. Then, at 8:00 pm the night before I departed, I received a call from front desk asking if I wanted a wake up call, car to the airport...Very early the following morning, the wake up call was five minutes late, and I had to call twice to get picked up by the standard golf cart shuttle - my second call was fully ten minutes after the first, and yet the clerk was clearly annoyed that I was doubting his word. When I got to the front desk, the bill wasn\'t ready on arrival, and had to be printed out slowly. Items from the minibar that I\'d had on my first day weren\'t charged yet, and when they discovered this there was a noticeably accusatory tone, as if it was my fault that the hotel hadn\'t bothered to restock the minibar in the several days I was there. Then when I went out to get into my car, my bags weren\'t there - while they had been picked up with me at my suite and placed in the same golf cart that I\'d been driven in, they hadn\'t been removed from the cart and were being given a spontaneous tour of the hotel grounds when the driver went to pick up someone else. They reappeared, and were loaded in the car. I was then subjected an uninterrupted slow begging process from the car driver the entire way to the airport, despite having paid a small fortune to the hotel. (Yes, it is probably unkind/insensitive of me to begrudge such begging, a fine tradition there, but frankly I think the hotel could afford to pay the drivers a better than average wage in exchange for an explicit no tipping policy).Unfortunately, while my direct experiences with the management were invariably positive, I have to conclude that they aren\'t making progress in instilling a genuine service mentality in the junior front desk staff. At a $100 or $150 hotel this would be forgivable at a hotel charging five times that it is not.The other problem I had was with the lack of sound insulation between my suite and my neighbors. There was a single connecting door that did nothing to prevent me from hearing everything going on next door, including the occupant humming along to music videos. Again, not at all in keeping with the private and tranquil image the hotel clearly wants to project.Liked &#x2014 Nice layoutDisliked &#x2014 Bad front desk',neg

'My family and I traveled to Culebra for the first time in early July, once we arrived to the dock we waited about 20 - 25 minutes for someone from the hotel to pick us up. Once we arrived to the hotel, it was desolate and deserted! If it weren\'t for the fact that other passengers were checking in with us I would\'ve thought we were the only ones in the hotel. there was no music the atmosphere was just BORING!!! We were unable to find a cab to take us to town, the food at the hotel was OVER PRICED! and it really wasn\'t worth the money. The staff at the hotel if you can call them that were very unwelcoming!! I had no idea that they breakfast was not an option at this hotel! The only good thing I can say about the hotel is that the room was decent, other than that I find this to be a bit over priced and over-rated!!! Oh, I called numerous times and also emailed to try and reconfirm my reservations and no one ever called me back!Room Tip: Room was clean....that&#39s it!See more room tips',neg
'This might one day be a great property when its finished and some practices are reviewed and substantially improved.Let\'s start with the goodThe rooms are really very nice, bright, airy, modern and clean, functional design. The bed is super comfortable, and perhaps the most outstanding feature. Very good bathrooms with a great rain shower and soaking tub. Floors are marble not wood, so make your feet feel quite cold. Still, fine for summer in India, but might be problematic in the winter month.All staff are well trained, really friendly and very accommodating. Smiles all around, people say hello to you, and there generally are \'good vibes\' about the place. There is a nice coffee shop in the lobby, and a small take-away deli with bread, cake and pastry - very useful if you have an early morning departure and you can buy something the night before for a small snack before you leave.On design, there is no door to the bathroom, so its more open plan ........ personally I am not a friend of such layouts as I like the bathroom to be closed off with a proper door, but its a matter of personal preference.Now the badRooms are still constructed and finished off. I stayed over a weekend, and construction noise started early in the morning and continued throughout the day. Forget sleeping in, or staying in your room for peace and quite. Overall, very disturbing and unexpected as the hotel opened already in May 2011. It seems that this will go on for a few month. However, towards the end of the year, this should not be a problem anymore.Finally the uglyInternet charges are outrageous. In this day and age, I believe the practice to still charge for internet connections is very questionable, and I\'d like to applaud hotel groups like the Shangri-La that make it complimentary and provide it as a part and parcel of the room. Making it complementary for loyalty program members is another good way, particular if you of an upper tier. The Leela Kempinski in India points the way here.However, at the Westin Gurgaon the charges are very high - amounting to about 15\% of the room charge! In addition, its exceptionally unclear for what you will be charged if you hook up multiple devices, like your business laptop and personal device as is not usual in the day and age. Your access time seems to be distributed between devices, and for two computer halved. Ringing the service line yielded a \'you will not be charged\' but still when you log-on, you need to accept charges which should not be ...... So I am bracing myself for one of those really bad surprises at check-out .....It seems that this problem has been going on since May when the property opened and multiple guest are confused about this and complained. Its in the process to be sorted out ..... In the meantime, the management would do well to leave an explanatory room in the room about their internet policy and practices.Room Tip: Make sure you are note next to a room where construction is still going on.See more room tips',neg
'So being a supposedly happening place in Pune and a much hyped mid night Buffet - my wife and i thought of trying this place around 2330 hours on July 1 , 2011 . Long line of que of cars and when our turn comes we come to know - no vallet parking . Then we are been asked to park the car at basement of shoppping mall opposite to the hotel . One our way - we ask the security whether dinner will be available - we are assured of the dinner . Post parking we walk upto the hotel along with other people and get the shock of the lifetime . the security guard does not allow us to get in and says Full Hai , we try to convince him that we can try out the coffee shop - but he closes the gate on our face . there were other hapless people like us who were trying to get in and some had friends inside but still were not allowed inside . The Guards were real rude and looked more like goons rather than trained security guards ...All we wanted was some food in the night - and a sandwich at the coffee shop also would have done , but ......Definitely not recommended',neg
'Undoubtedly the property is amazing and very nicely done up, the food is also good..... But once on a stay u also look out for other services too. A caution to all those who would like a stay here.... Please be careful with the management...... they staff just walks in without intimating.... u will not even know when they walked in and they dont even care if youre asleep. They dont do up your room so housekeeping staff is a total waste. Please also check your bills before you leave because they make you pay for bills that u have already paid for. So A Big Piece of Advice please stay ALERT u never know how the and when the management will respond. For all these blunders the HO had said they would reimburse me a days tariff which hasnt happened till date!!!Liked &#x2014 Lovely location great propertyDisliked &#x2014 Bad management, untrained staff, non commited',neg
'The Crowne Plaza is in Electronic City which is on the fringe of Bengaluru and approximately 20 Kms from city centre. If you choose to stay here then you probably have business in the Electronic City. This Hotel suffers from what can be described as the most indifferent and inexperienced staff I have seen in a long time. My check in was painful. No one bothered to take my bags from the car and when I complained, the black jacket at the front office replied that they could have missed me in the crowd. He was busy selling the loyalty program and forgot to get my ID Xeroxed. He also gave me the wrong room ( a twin bed instead of the King bed that I booked). They took more then one hour to find me the room I booked and finally gave me a room at 3 PM.Sleep quality was miserable. You can hear people walking, talking, opening and closing doors through out the night. This was not all. The Hotel had some maintenance work going on (plumbing or carpentry) and I called the Duty manager at 11.30 PM to complain since I could not sleep. He promised to stop it immediately but the noise continued well until 2 AM and I lost a whole nights sleep.If you are planning a stay here during the week ends  God save you. There are huge parties (wedding, reception etc. ) and the place would put a fish market to shame. This is an extremely annoying Hotel.',neg
'I traveled to Pune from Spain recently for a friend\'s wedding. A group of us (Indians and Westerners) tried to go to the nightclub at Le Meridien after the wedding. We were denied entry because we were wearing traditional Indian clothes. Their policy is western clothing only. I was appalled that we were being discriminated against for wearing the clothes of the country we were in, and our Indian hosts were clearly embarrassed. Meanwhile, the manager let in plenty of other people wearing gym shoes and other clothing that would be deemed completely inappropriate at a nightclubs in the west.The whole situation was shocking. I can\'t believe there are policies like that in place today in Western-owned establishments, and no one is making a bigger deal.',neg
'I stayed at Bahia Marina Resort on July 17 for 2 nights. The resort is ok, not amazing, needs a LOT of improvement. The staff needs a tune-up and an aggressive training as soon as possible if they want to stay in business. The day we got to the hotel, July 17, 2009, they couldnt find our reservation and didnt have anything available for a party of 6. That night, finally they gave us a room for 4 people. We told Mr. Nazario if he was aware that we were 6 and not 4, his answer was dont worry we do this all the time. We had no other choice than stay there for that night. Two of us slept on the tile floor. Next day, they moved us to a 6 people room it was nice, newer, not very clean, but it was ok, there was enough room for everyone. When we did the check-out of the room, they charged us for a six people room on the first night (more than $100.00 difference). We explained to them what happened on our first night, but they insisted we needed to pay that amount (they already had our credit card no.). Not even a Were sorry for what had happened as a courtesy to the customer. Weve being trying to resolve this problem thru the credit card, but it is a waist of time. Now Mr. Nazario claims that we were 9 people in the room. I want to let him know that we are not cattle. If we needed two or three rooms, we would have got them. But this is not about the money, its the attitude and the arrogance, and that is not going to stop us from claiming what is not fair. There were only 6 people, no more. He has no excuse for what he did to us. He was never friendly, looking at us over the shoulder and always whispering to the other employees in front of us, rude and careless of our situation. It seemed like it was our fault they couldnt find our reservation. You definitively cant call that SERVICE or HOSPITALITY. If youre traveling to Culebra, it is an AMAZING island with GREAT potential, BEAUTIFUL virgin beaches, nice people, GREAT restaurants, and very accessible from the main island. People like Mr. Nazario make what could be a great experience a bitter one and hurts the reputation of the people from Culebra and Puertoricans in general.',neg
'The only thing good about this hotel is its location. Other than that there is hardly anything to write home about. The service leaves a lot desired as does cleanliness.

'Bahia Marina Resort has the best location in the island, breath taking views and very well equipped condos. Unfortunately, not very customer oriented employees.

Ive been working in this industry for 23 years in Orlando, Florida (one of the top visited tourist areas in the world) and Ive never seen a hotel manager as rude and clueless. It was such a bad experience that even though we liked and enjoyed the place, we will never stay there again and DONT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.',neg
'I have stayed at numeroous Taj hotels across India, and was expecting something similar at this hotel. I arrived on a late night flight from bangalore and was met on arrival by the hotel car, for which I paid nearly Rs2000. Upon reaching the hotel, I was made to stand in lobby for over 10 minutes, though there were no other check ins at 12 am at nite. When I finally got the room key, I made my way and upon opening the room, was disappointed at the small room size. I had requested King bed, but was told all rooms were full so had to put up with Queen bed.Buffet breakfast was so so, had some South Indian and pastries. Location of this hotel is not too convenient for someone who wants to stroll around. Luckily, I was only here for 1 nite.This Blue diamond was not really a diamond but just an ordinary stone, not your typical Taj hotel&gt',neg
'The hotel is a really nice place but the rooms where really dirty. We stayed at the two bedroom villas which was really spacious. We found earthworms at both showers, roaches in both rooms and two bees at one of the bathrooms, even though all the doors and windows were closed. When we got in the room there was a pantiliner wrapper and a plastic cup under one of the beds. Spiderwebs on the ceiling of the bedrooms. The dishes were also really dirty with what looked to be some sort of small insect eggs. Bed sheets had holes and stains in them Most of the staff was not friendly at all and they even forgot to pick us up at the beach (an arrangement we had made with them) so we had to go walking from Punta Soldado beach to the hotel. The only thing I would recommend about the hotel is the restaurant (but it was a bit expensive). The food is really good and the waiter was nice. No breakfast or lunch (just dinner but it is not included in the package). Overall, I was disappointed with my stay at this hotel.',neg
'I have stayed only once at this hotel. The location of this one, from my perspective, is the best as most of my work is on Dhole Patil Road (an office building called Centrepoint). In general too, the location of this hotel would be excellent since it is literally, just a hop skip and jump from the Pune Railway Station (however, it needs to be pointed out that someone staying here would most probably not be traveling by train, even if it were from Mumbai, so proximity to the station may not be relevant).However, I found the hotel to be extremely expensive for its services. At the outset, when I checked in there was no one to guide me to the reservation desk. Neither did anyone help with the luggage. I might as well have been invisible. Only when one asked was one directed to the desired area. The check in was all right however the luggage coming to the room took a long time. The whole layout at the entrance lobby was a little confusing.Two things struck me in that one night that I stayed there. One, everything including the room was very dimly light. A kind of gloominess pervades the entire hotel with little natural light. Even the rooms are very poorly lit (looks like an attempt to be classy has gone horribly wrong). The other is the unexplained use of French. Everything in the menu is written in French (the room service menu). Directions are in French. The food seems to cater to the French. I really found it quite unfathomable. It felt like a mini revolution against the use of the English language. Even some of the waiters spoke French. Ridiculous! Other than that it was like any other five star hotel. In the one night I stayed there, I did not even see, let alone use, any of the other facilities like gym or swimming pool so I cannot comment on that.All in all, the experience, t 30\% higher than other hotels, was not really a great one. Dont think I shall be going back to that hotel any more.',neg
'I stayed at the Lalit Ashok since it as the venue of a conference I needed to attend, and I thought it would be convenient. Well - no denying that it was - I didn\'t need to brave the traffic etc, to get to the event on time etc. But - sadly, that is the only thing the hotel had going for it. While my registration slip mentioned Golf view room, when I drew the curtains, I saw a concrete hotel balcony outside my room! The food (both in-room service and their 24x7 cofee shop) was really, REALLY bad! And I tried different cuisine, hoping they\'d get atleast something right...nah, that didn\'t happen. Their appams were as bad as their biryani, as bad as the italian (if you can call it that). As for their coffee shop - even the times when there were barely any guests around in that fairly large room, it was dificult to catch the waiter\'s eye - they just seemed to congregate in one place and chat amongst themselves. They also seem to have an issue with serving water - if you don\'t specifically ask for water, you\'re not going to get any!! Let\'s turn to the place itself - Bengaluru was really, really hot while I was there and yet, the air conditioning in the lobby area of the hotel was almost non-existent. Yes, I know there was a time, long, long ago when you didn\'t even need fans in this city but someone needs to tell those guys that this is no longer the case!!Here\'s what really got my goat - the rooms are so, so noisy!! All through my stay there, I would hear things being dragged or really squeaky wheels being rolled right outside my corridor at all times of the night....3:30 AM is what I last recorded! And the staff has no qualms about shouting in the corridors either - really unprofessional! Oh and by the way- no free internet out here - you need to pay to get WIFI etc.!! Which age are these guys living in???The gist of it is this - there are plenty of other good hotels in Bengaluru these days - places that are cheaper and have much better service - I\'d suggest you try one of those instead of The Lalit Ashok (unless you don\'t care about the food/noise/heat etc.).',neg
'Arrived early in the morning to loud banging around the pool as some scaffolding was being taken down. No warnings given that this would continue for the next 24 hrs as my room overlooked the pool. The hotel is very bland with little character and the restaurant serves rather uninspiring food. I had a very unpleasant incident with money being removed from my mini-safe and although the manager tried, I was unconvinced of his conclusions - I won\'t go any further on this. I was also woken up (along with all of the 5th floor) at 0500 hrs one morning with a very large noisy party in the hallway. This lasted for over 20 minutes and ringing the reception didn\'t seem to result in anything positive being done. The staff were friendly but when you are the only one in the bar at 730pm, I guess they have to be! Wouldn\'t stay again as there are far better hotels offering better services and facilities for the same price. Overall a disappointing experience.',neg
'I booked a nine day stay based on the positive reviews and flashy website with my wife and 2 young children. We arrived at the reception to a very formal welcome..Hello, passports please, lets go to your room. My first impression of the room was that of a tired and lazy effort, the walls lights were not parallel (one was bent), skirtings/blinds/walls all stained. I thought \'Oh my God, I paid a fortune for this dump\'.I waited till the next day to form a better opinion. At the restaurant it did not get better, every day for nine days I had to ask the same 3 questions, Could I have some tea please?, water please? a teaspoon please?. There is no kitchen attached to the restaurant, each order if telephoned to another location, so when my prawns arrived they were cold. Complimentary use of the massage chair, read a sign when you enter the resort. When I went to see it, it looked like a 20 year old piece of junk with disconnected wires at the back of it !The 4 poster beds near the pool had sheets on them that resembled as if they had been dragged through the slums, and were rarely changed more than every 3/4 days, with bird poo covered at all times on the roof sheets. I spoke to 2 other guests, one from Scotland and the 2nd from Leicester, both bitterly dissapointed. The 2nd checked out early and went to a similair resort for half the price.I am really shocked that they manage to charge up to £100 per night, for a flashy website to a group of unnasuming Europeans.The only positives was the ambience by the pool and surrounding gardens. Would I recommend this Hotel, I think you already know the answer. Two words to describe the hotel...rip and off. Ismail (Leicester)',neg
'I\'ve stayed at this property twice. The first time I was ugpraded (using platinum certificate) to the 09 suite on the corner of the hotel. The room itself is quite nice, with a very large bathroom and floor to ceiling glass in the extra big shower however, the street noise (honk honk honk scooter motors etc.) on the busy corner is very noticeable through the thin glass windows/doors. Upon booking a reservation for a second visit, i specifically requested a quiet room away from the main intersection, and I stayed in a room 21 suite at the corner of the hotel on the side road far from the main intersection however, the street noise was still very noticeable. The windows in the hotel are simply too thin.On the plus side, the breakfast is good (although not any better than the Westin Pune). Because of the street noise, I can\'t recommend the property.Room Tip: I don&#39t think there are any quiet rooms at this property. Avoid unless you sleep with ear plugs...See more room tips',neg
'As newly-weds, my bride and I were very excited about spending our wedding night at the Pune Marriott. It was a very kind gift from a family friend who was a frequent visitor and patron of the hotel.We arrived at the hotel late on Dec 14, straight from our wedding festivities. I found it a trifle odd that during check-in, it was openly announced that our family friend had reserved a room for us using gift vouchers, and that to avail of the reservation, we would need to present the vouchers in its original physical form. Firstly, this was surprising because the Pune Marriott sent a booking confirmation email on Nov 28 which was forwarded to my family. It did not make any mention of presenting vouchers or speak about any formalities needed to check in.Secondly, one would think a reputed international chain of hotels like the Marriott would exercise more discretion with their guests. Whether cash or gift vouchers or solid gold was used to book a room for our wedding night is immaterial to my bride and I. For us, it was and remains a very generous gesture. But by announcing to us upfront that the booking was made gift vouchers - that too the tone with which it was done by the receptionist - it came across as patronizing. Back at the check-in desk, we had no idea about this gift voucher. And we certainly did not want to disturb our family friend late at night. The receptionist said we needed to produce the original vouchers before we checked out. The fact that the onus of producing these vouchers was squarely placed on our shoulders - newly weds exhausted from days of festivities - beggars belief to this day. The Pune Marriott evidently has a baffling way of treating just married couples.We even paid to upgrade to a suite. But instead of enjoying the wedding night, I was getting in touch with my family asking them if they knew about this supposed gift voucher. Our understanding was the booking confirmation email we received from the hotel verifies and - well - confirms the booking. I obtained the duty manager\'s email address and got my mother to resend the booking confirmation email later that night to him/her. It was a minor hassle to bother my folks for this, but we thought the matter would be laid to rest. We were sadly mistaken. The next morning during check-out, the same receptionist even confirmed receiving the booking confirmation email, but still blindly insisted on seeing the original gift voucher. Failing this, we were told I would need to pay for the booking. A frantic chain of calls from me to my family to our family friend ensued. I tried explaining to the receptionist that perhaps this gift voucher was already submitted to their reservations office. Why else would we receive a booking confirmation email? But she wouldn\'t listen and kept parroting the hotel\'s policies. At one point, we felt as if it was being insinuated that my bride and I were trying to swindle the Pune Marriott by trying to escape without paying. Hardly the magical experience we were hoping for as newly weds in a supposedly fancy hotel. It was only later that we were made to wait and your staff bothered to check our room reservation. After what seemed like an eternity, we were met by another staff member - the pitifully-trained, uncouth receptionist who dealt with us didn\'t even offer us an apology - who sheepishly admitted what happened was an embarrassing mistake on their side. Turns out it was a case of the Pune Marriot\'s left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing. The gift voucher in question was personally submitted by our family friend weeks in advance to the reservations desk. He had the humility to say they should have checked our reservation internally before burdening us with the task of proving we are not frauds. And to apologize for this horrid, insulting experience? A box of chocolates! Even if we didn\'t live in Belgium, that\'s downright pathetic. A wedding night is something one is supposed to cherish all their lives. The Pune Marriott staff ruined it for us. I wonder how much they emulated the core values trumpeted on the Marriott website. http://www.marriott.com/corporateinfo/culture/coreValues.miI\'ve been to Marriott hotels in many cities and countries and was excited that one had finally opened in my hometown. But the people of Pune deserve better. We certainly deserved to be treated better.I hope in the future the hotel will do its homework before treating guests shabbily.',neg

'We stayed at the Westin Gurgaon twice on our trip to India and on both occasions the hotel tried to rip us off on the airport transfer.On our first stay we were flying at 7am so had a very early check-out and having asked the night before about taxis were told it wouldn\'t be a problem at this hour. The next morning upon check-out we were told it would be at least an hour before a taxi would come but the hotel car was available. The hotel car costs 1900 INR to drop you at the airport, the taxi from the airport cost 300 INR. Naturally because we had to make our flight we had no choice but take the hotel car.Our second time we had a late night flight and requested a late check-out the day before and asked about a taxi, again this would not be a problem. Upon check-out the next day the same as previous - a taxi will take a long time to get but the hotel car is available. This time with hours to spare we were happy to wait for a taxi. We did however complain to the hotel manager that the hotel seems to have a practice of running this scam, we were essentially told our complaint was inappropriate. Having spent two months in India you become accustomed to the all-pervasive feeling you\'re being ripped off. You don\'t expect it from a Westin hotel, even if it is India it should be following the international standards of the chain and brand.Apart from this horrible experience the hotel itself is good with clean rooms which are very comfortable. The hotel has a nice pool although the Delhi haze and pollution makes it hard to enjoy. Restaurant and bar is already overpriced before they add the city and service taxes.If you\'re staying here and need an airport transfer insist on a taxi and clarify that this is not the hotel car or arrange one yourself, it might be easier!',neg
'This was our fifth visit tot the hotel in the last three years. This time we planned may as the kids school holiday\'s were coming to an end. We have always loved this hotel and preferred it to the other five stars in South Goa due to it\'s location, ambience and the serenity it\'s offers which is really required when one is taking a break from the faced paced life in Mumbai. Have always given this place a lot of reccomendations but unfortunately this time we had a very disappointing experience because of the detroiating service standards in the hotel !!! am a very Selective traveler and attention to detail is important to me and due to work pressure we land up taking 2 holidays only every year!! we arrived into the hotel during lunch time , we went to Vivo the coffee shop as We we horrified with our first meal at the start of vacation which gave us th taste of being at a wedding where the caterer cooks for the masses and doesnt care about presentation or quality. And it\'s sad that after calling the GM of the hotel and speaking to the head of F &amp B services about my disappointment in the food quality were we promised attention to food. All I can is that besides one night of having a good meal from spice studio the other meals were below average!!! Forget expectations on local goan food , the other fare wouldn\'t excite your pallet at all !! I did get an opportunity to meet with the Head Chef who was pretty outright in telling me that the choice of food was to cater the large groups !! We had a fantastic experience eating out at Nostalgia and even at Martin\'s but all select foodie\'s would not recommend the food at the hotel at all!! They have a gorgeous infinity pool and also a new wing which houses another pool which we enjoyed !!! Our SPA exereince was also good!! To summarise all I can say is that it\'s a great place to stay with courteous staff but definately not a good place to eat in!!!

'Both my girlfriend and I are currently staying in this hotel and are both starwood preferred members. We\'ve stayed at many starwood hotels throughout many countries and I can say that this hotel is my least favorite. The hotel itself is pretty and the staff are nice, its that nothing seems to work. The problems I\'ve had so far should be non-issues and no brainers, but have been very troublesome. The constant construction is very noisy and appears to be on all sides of our room. After calling reception 3 different times, I got the hammering to stop. It started at 8am and when you are on vacation, its obnoxious to be awaken early.the internet sucks after calling reception, maintenance came to my room. the wifi signal is very low to no signal and the booster he installed wouldn\'t work either. I was told to plug in my computer to the lan connection (it took another 30 mins for him to track down the cable). this is pretty annoying considering the wifi costs 15 usd (650 rupees). Even in the lobby, the wifi only works in some places close to the front desk. Honestly, its just not what you expect from a 5 star hotel.noise: the windows overlooking the city are very thin and transmit the constant honking of Indian traffic right into the rooms. day and night. the pool: its currently 108 degrees, the pool is in the shade and a good temp, however its brown colored and I\'m not allowed into it. great way to top off the stay by taking away one of the few reasons I chose this hotel. overall, unsatisfied for a 5 star starwood hotel. I wish I had chosen a different one.',neg
'We booked 3 nights in the soul vacation as we liked the website and other decriptions on tripadvisor. As an European traveller we were completely unsatisfied with the quality of the place. It looked old and the well advertised spa looked shabby and dirty. There is constant and loud music played at the pool. The bathroom was dirty and mouldy. One hour after we checked in we decided to leave but the hotel made us pay for at least one night. We were not happy with the staff and found them rather unfriendly. Their is also no direct access to the beach and you have to walk almost through Colva\'s main area to get there. We were not too impressed with Colva - it looked very touristy and quite busy. We were looking for quietness, a place to relax and a nice spa but this was not the place.Room Tip: The rooms on the first floorSee more room tips',neg
'We had heard a lot about Oberoi Vanya Vilas when we set out the property does not dissapoint in its sheer beauty.However the service was a revelation at how bad things could get.The dining service was dismal for both the nights we were there at dinner time- the kids fell off to sleep waiting for the food. The breakfast was equally slow. We had paid up for breakfast and dinner so we had to bear the slow torture. The food would come together after a long wait or at random sequence.The staff had a knack of saying the wrong things eg- the foreigners eat lighter breakfasts and are on time(point noted...indians eat heavier breakfasts so they are not catering to us...when will we get over this firang complex!!!!)the howler was we know u dont want to go but it is time for u to catch your train Someone needs to give them a crash course on etiquette to make them worthy of the money we pay for their services.We did bring it up to the GM who would hopefully look into it....but the service did spoil our holiday and I guess there is no way anyone can make up for it',neg

'The outdoors of the place is very beautiful, unfortunately the bedroom was full of cob webs and some dead roaches underneath the bed as a welcoming throughout my 4 day stay. Housekeeping never even bothered, all they did was make the beds. One night I spent 2 hours at the Dakiti restaurant, I practically had to beg to get 2 drinks throughout the 2 hours. The dinner I had reserved in advanced had already been sold but I did get a console dinner, after getting a discount for my frustration, this 2 dinner meal came out close to $100, Where in the rest of the island, good food and great svc doesn\'t cost more than $55. Two of my requests to a female worker at the desk were completely ignored. The one that left a very good impression on my husband and myself was the new manager Luis, he absolutely went out of his way to fulfill every request including the ones that were ignored by the other worker, he never made a face (like the other lady) and was more than happy to accommodate us as much as he could, even though he had just started working there a few days prior to our arrival. If anyone wants to see pictures of the room full of cobwebs and dead roach, feel free to e-mail me. In Culebra it is very easy to get transportation from the airport to the rest of the island, it is also very convinient to rent a car as soon as you arrive. I rented from Bahia Marina (Thrifty\'s). The inside of the car was dirty and hard to see when driving since the inside of the windshield had a nice film of dirt throughout. The last thing I wanted to do was clean my car rental and encounter dead roaches and cob webs in my room during my vacation. I\'ve been going to Culebra for the past 9 years at least twice a year and have never been through this before.Liked &#x2014 The pool area was peacefulDisliked &#x2014 service, housekeeping',neg
'I normally stay at Marriott or Taj in Pune . This time i had to stay at le meridian since my colleague was staying there. The restaurants are bad and serve poor quality food. The gym is not very neat and there is no one to attend to you. Air conditioning is worse there is this foul smell all the time in the room. You never feel fresh.',neg
'I chose the hotel because of the LEED Gold rating of the building, meaning it is designed to be very environmentally friendly. However, the price which is even higher than Taj Blue Diamond, is not comparable at all. In style with my other posts:The good:-When they make mistakes, the management is keen on my feedback and they even gave me chocolates to say that they are sorry. That is sweet of them.-When something bad happens they call and ask what happened. But i don\'t know if this actually helps for future guests. Someone must have let them know before i came to stay there.The bad:-This is the hotel in India with the most No that you I have heard from staff. I think it is because American rules are enforced on an Indian staff which culturally is not used to this word. They almost say no before you have asked your question.-If I say no to something they offer, many of the staff will insist. This becomes almost a burden. Service is nice, but they should learn that in the North, a no one time means no, and not like it could be in the South where a no is a polite reply although the respondent means yes.-If i ask for laundry to be picked up, this can take more than 15 minutes. In general, things take a long time here.-Some times things never came. Once for breakfast i asked for porridge. I left 60 minutes later not ever seeing it. I had to remind them about stuff a few times. Waterbottles at the pool could take 15 minutes too, or more.-When my shirt was ironed, it had awkward creases going all the way down the back. I educated the staff but im not sure they will remember.-Idly and sambar for breakfast is not good. Only two chutneys, and the sambar is very watery. Idly is granular and not soft.-My broccoli smoothie was wrong. I found out after two days that they had blanched it although i specifically asked for Raw No cooking when ordering. I had to inquire the chef. Other hotels usually get it the first time.-They are reluctant to serve strawberries although it was in season locally. Other hotels in india will order the fruits you ask for so they are there next day.-They had canned juice posing as fresh, pressed grape juice. The grapes they served were imported, although it was in season locally.-sometimes when i ask for stuff, it seem like the staff wants to go home. it makes me hesitant to ask for things which makes my stay nicer.-they served me green tea bags with water at 40 degrees celcius.-shirt for pressing was returned with stains.Is this worth it for the eco friendliness? I am thinking of doing Taj blue diamond next time in pune. It is an awesome hotel.As a standard in my reviews, I will add recommendations of things I seldom find in any hotel. I do this because I know hotel management often reads thesel:-Go greener. Ask when booking if one the guest wants to take steps to make their stay more conscious. If they answer yes, give them a menu of things to do including: Fewer towels and pillows to save water less cutlery and dishes when ordering in room dining breakfast, with local, seasonal vegetarian items cleaning of room only on specified days + any other action that helps other people and the environment.-If you are doing any efforts like giving food to orphanages, giving employees decent salaries and benefits and good working hours, using bio degradable detergent, inform the guests. Inform them in a way that highlights the benefits to people and environment.-Include green, fair trade items in the menus. Include organic stuff. Make people think of this as an obvious choice by promoting values of care for others and the environment.-Make all soaps, shampoos etc bio degradable and fair trade and organic as far as possible.',neg
'We were charmed by the rooms inside, however, everything else made us move to a different hotel.Rooms are decorated very nicely and are absolutely clean. All have views on the swimming pool. It\'s a small place, very private and the service is very nice and dedicated however:1. They forgot to pick us up at 5 am from the airport, were late by an hour and tried to come up with a lie about some external problem causing delay. Only the day after they admitted they forgot.2. They did not feel guilty of inconvenience and we had to point out that this level of service is not satisfactory but no solutions were found3. The swimming pool was absolutely dirty and after my question when it will be better the answer was maybe in 4 days (and in 4 days we were leaving). Access to the pool is necessary in this hotel since no access to the beach is granted4.The buildings, chairs and tables were not clean white as in pictures but during our stay many workers were running around painting everything. This promises good view in future, but it also means, they should\'ve closed the hotel for renovation and not try to get money from clients who expected a beautiful place5. Some food is really great, but chicken with parmesan and mojito made us a little sick so try before eating all. (however, other foods like kababs were fantastic)All in all, we moved, but the staff did not make problems about it, even though we booked for 5 days, so a big plus for being sincere and fair. The hotel should like and work nice pretty soon but ask before you go.',neg
'I spent a week at the Taj Blue Diamond in Pune and found it lacking in several respects. First, there is a major renovation of the hotel going on, meaning the entire front is torn out and being rebuilt. Construction runs 6 days per week from relatively early until around 7 pm. This is very bad if you are jet lagged and need to sleep during the day. Even worse, it means the front desk is now on the 1st floor cramped into a corner in front of the elevators. Very disappointing. Even worse, if you use the pool during the day, the construction crew watch you with interest from the hole in the wall overlooking the pool. Odd! The food was ok. The rave reviews about the Indian restaurant are not deserved in my view. There are much better options outside the hotel a short car ride away. I had a couple of Chicken kebabs that were only partially cooked. Also, the waiters in the Coffee Shop made errors on my order at least twice during the week. And breakfast that is included in the room rate was of very poor quality relative to the hotel rates. Pune has several new hotel options that either just opened or are soon opening. I would strongly recommend checking out the O Hotel, Oakwood service apartments, or Westin (when it opens) as much nicer options than the Taj. Lets hope the renovations finish soon and lift this hotel up from its current mediocre levels.',neg
'We made a reservation at Bahia Marina in Jan. 2009 for a trip in Dec. 2009 for our 20th anniversary. Shortly after, we received a notice that my husbands job was in jeopardy so I called and cancelled the reservation &amp emailed the hotel the memo we received. We cancelled the reservation within two weeks and it is April now (over 3 months later) and we STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REFUND OF $1,700.00! I have called numerous times, and have been promised by Nellie that our refund will be done that day. It has never shown up on our bill, so I have no other choice, but to contact our credit card company about this charge. The management has not proven to be honorable, and this is sad because it is a nice resort. Be very careful when making a reservation here.',neg
'My family and I stayed there for a few days in July. Based on reviews, we expected this to be a better than average place. What we found was quite the opposite. I will mention the positive first. The people were real nice but living in denial. The room was very dirty. We had to sweep the floors and mop from wall to wall. There was mildew that could be seen as well as smelled. We used a full can of lysol trying to cover the smell. The walls were dirty and the bedspread had hair and dirt all over it. The windows leaked and we could not keep the mosquitos out. The futon was also dirty and smelled. Lastly, we had to stamp out several roaches. Also, the Hot Tub by the pool was cold. There is no reason why they could not do a lot better at this resort. So much for a nice family getaway!',neg
'My wife and myself,decided to spend a week at the Oberoi Hurghada,after having visited Four Seasons at Sharm el Sheikh several times over the last few years.This proved a big and expensive mistake.1.At the airport,the driver of the pre-booked limousine,althoughthere were only two couples wrote the wrong name, so ittook ages to actually realize that we were the expected guests. It also took a lot of time to check us in,with no welcome drink.Actually their front desk is their weak point,because they were unable to help in anything:-A bag from their gift shop which was supposed to be delivered to our room,remained there for 3 days and despite several calls,we still had to go and pick it up ourselves.-No request to them was actually fullfilled,including the bill at check out,where they overcharged us by two nights,and it also took ages to make them realize their mistake at 06.00 am. 2.The so-called suite was reasonable,and the house keeping very good,(with the help of some daily baksheesh).However,just outside the room,they were renovating a section of the Hotel,and a huge amount of rubbish,building material,empty boxes,furniture etc,were lying around,making a really horrible site.Fellow British guests complained to London,and after that the Manager apologised and took some action to tidy the place.This was effective for only one day,after which the same ugliness.3.The restaurants had excellent food and service,except for the breakfast,which was poor with an unattractve buffet and beeing taken at the main restaurant,had an awfull smell every morning fron the previous nights dinner.4.Having the same prices at the Four Seasons,but beeing waybelow at everything,we will never repeat the same mistake.Thanks',neg
'I have stayed at this hotel many times on business. It is a business hotel and it is always very busy so book way in advance.

The hotel rooms are not the best and a bit foisty.

'Just back from nine nights at the Oberoi Sahl Hasheesh. While the hotel and the rooms are fine, we had a series of problems which management only rectified slowly.First, once we got to our room, we noticed that the toilet was blocked. We called reception and they sent a guy who - after two hours - left saying that it worked, while it didn\'t. We then asked to change room, but they again sent the same guy for another four !) hours. He left the bathroom extremely dirty, but in spite of repeatedly complaining with reception, they did not properly disinfect for another 24 hours.We also noticed a cockroach coming out of the air conditioning system in the room: clearly, not the cleanest place. As we got extremely sick while there (but not on the Nile cruise), we are afraid the same standards of cleanliness apply to the kitchens.The pool was very nice, but the water temperature was too cold (they only heat it in winter).The beach was OK, but there are corals in the sea, so you can\'t simply go for a swim (you need to go via the pier).Finally, everything in the hotel is incredibly expensive (average cost of a dinner: GBP90 for two people with wine).Overall, we will not go back.Dada, LondonLiked &#x2014 RoomsDisliked &#x2014 Not clean enoughTips/Secrets &#x2014 Don\'t go',neg

'As a group of six, we booked three rooms for xmas 2011 at the \'luxury\' resort of Soul Vacation in Colva, GoaAs advertised, the \'resort\' is set in beautiful tropical gardens arranged around the pool comprising approx 10 villas with typically 4 rooms in each - so far so goodWe arranged for two taxis to pick our group up from Goa airport and were met by two courteous and cheerful drivers who loaded our luggage and drove us the 25 minute ride from airport to hotelOn arrival at 11pm on the Friday before xmas, we were a little disappointed to find that the bar and restaurant was closed, there was no room service and the place appeared to be deserted..... No matter, we walked the five minutes or so into town and found lots of venues that were capable of resolving our hunger and thirstThe rooms - built, according to the bar man, approximately ten years ago, have had no significant sums spent on them since construction - far from luxurious, they can best be described as adequate..... Think mouldy shower areas, rickety cupboards and grubby sinks and you will start to get the picture. Unfortunately, dated and mouldy isn\'t the worst of it..... Our aircon didn\'t work for 3 of the 4 nights (its 35degC in Goa in Dec - you need good aircon!) we stayed there and when it did it was noisy and inadequate, the \'flat\' screen tv (not a particularly important feature of the room for us) was a 1990\'s CRT rather than an LCD or Plasma that you normally associate with the term \'flat\'. The bed was a small double by modern hotel standards, and was reasonably comfortable, but unfortunately, the poly cotton linens were dire and the duvet and pillows were of the spongy synthetic type from a bygone eraThe pool - at a distance and per the website photographs looked really appealing, in reality, the water was cloudy to the point that we didn\'t put anything other than our feet in it - we didn\'t see it cleaned for the four days that we stayed and not a hint of chlorine or other sterilisation was evidentThe restaurant - realistically a breakfast only venue provided very limited fare -basically a choice of two fruits, pineapple juice, an omelette or a vegetarian curry - all very good (especially the omelette), but where was the orange juice, dosa\'s, indian breads, yoghurts, pastries, scrambled or other eggs, cheeses, cold meats and so on that are normally to be found in a \'luxury\' establishmentSo to conclude - Soul Vacation is in a good location, has lovely friendly staff and can muster up a half decent cappuccino at breakfast when the machine is working (that\'ll be extra though), and if you paid approximately £50 a night for your room you may feel that it was reasonable experience - if you were expecting a luxury or boutique hotel and paid £150 a room as we did, you are going to be fairly disappointedEven though \'Soul Vacation\' didn\'t meet expectations, please don\'t be put of visiting Colva - it is a simple and rustic beachside town with a wonderful vibe, great bars and restaurants and lovely people - check out the boomerang bar with its fantastic tandoor, delicious breads and resident masseur.....superb!Room Tip: No view of pool from ground floor rooms and few upstairs rooms have a view either, despite claims to...See more room tips',neg

'We recently stayed here based on Tripadvisor reviews, and were very disappointed. In fairness, the staff were very helpful and pleasant, the view was beautiful. But the unit we stayed in was run down, furniture was old and worn, refrigerator was covered in rust, stove top was greasy, bathrooms had mildew, and then found several cockroaches. Sheets were threadbare, like gauze. For the $, would not ever stay here again. We couldn\'t move to a different unit because everything was filled. Since the units are independently owned, maybe there is no standard to which owners are required to comply. Unit was clean, but shabby.Room Tip: Don&#39t stay here.See more room tips',neg
'This is a former Government owned hotel and no matter how much they claim to have renovated it, there\'s still a down at heel institutional feel to it from the barren grounds to the dull reception. This hotel is in the middle of nowhere. While the staff are very pleasant and helpful they can\'t make up for its many faults. The breakfast buffet was adequate at best but we did have a memorable meal at the Chinese restaurant on the top floor. The elevators have seen better days and, although the rooms have been fairly nicely decorated they have a few problems beyond the low quality furnishings. When the air conditioning turns on the smell of damp/mould was very unpleasant. Of course, the scurrying we could hear in the ceiling of all three of our rooms may also have been a clue. After a change of rooms made no difference, we checked out, happily losing the cost of our two remaing nights, and headed for The Oberoi where, admittedly, we paid almost twice the price but got 10 times the qualty. Bangalore hotel prices are skyrocketing but if you get what seems like a great deal in comparison at the Ashok, remember, there\'s a very good reason for it.Liked &#x2014 Checking outDisliked &#x2014 Being there!!!',neg
'Starying at the Suryagarh and very disappointed with the service. The hotel is beautiful, excellent decor, great views, etc etc etc. Alas the service is not up to par. Checked in today and wanted to take a shower after checking in. NO HOT WATER. Called front desk and they send some one to look into it. He says wait 10 minutes and the water will be hot. Went into the shower and no hot water showed up! Took a cold water shower even though I had a flu. Called them again and they said they will send someone up. Again same story: wait a bit! I finally lost my nerve and told them I have waited more than 1/2 an hour and theres no hot water. I even took a shower with cold water. Seemed like I was talking to the walls, so I finally went down to the reception to lodge my complaint. All this while my wife was waiting to shower in the room. The lady from the reception came up with me to the room to check on the hot water and god knows what they did and we finally had hot water. To top it off, after dinner, we came to our room only to find an extra bed that we had not ordered in the room! Staying here tomorrow as well. But so far its a BIG TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR ME. They need to get their act together if they want to charge these prices. Service is really not up to par. I travel all over the world and this would probably end up in the bottom 5 experiences!!Room Tip: Think twice before choosing this hotel!See more room tips',neg
'My husband and I stayed at Bahia Marina the first week of July. We booked our stay based on the reviews on TripAdvisor, which we have used almost exclusively for recommendations on hotels for the last five years all across Europe and the Caribbean, probably amounting to at least 20 or so different hotels. Our taste in hotels is typically the off-the-beaten-path, boutique, hidden gem types. We are not resort dwellers by any stretch. In all this time, the TripAdvisor reviews have never steered us wrong. That is, until now.I believe the Bahia Marina rooms are individually owned (I could be wrong), which might explain why the rooms are hit or miss. We checked in and were given room B101. Let me be clear..if you are given room B101, dont even bother looking. Ask for a new room. We do not require luxury, but we do require cleanliness and B101 is not clean and it is not comfortable. From the first minute the door was opened for us, we smelled the (sour? mildewy? just old?) room. The room is worn and tired and, with the exception of the relatively new kitchen appliances, needs much more than the cursory, quick once-over cleaning it must have been getting over the months or years. The floors were dirty, there were white stains on one of the maroon comforters in the bedroom, the walls are dirty, and the futon.the FUTON! I can only describe the futon as greasy and smelling like the stink of a thousand dirty feet and butts. We had to keep sheets on the futon in order to make sitting on it tolerable. We cooked our own breakfasts every morning and the pans are in dire need of replacement. In particular, you cant cook with the frying pan without enjoying its non-stick coating flaking into your food. The water that drips from the air conditioner creates a puddle at the front door and there are no door mats to keep from tracking dirty water into the room. When it rains, water comes in under the front door (when it is closed). B101 is on the bottom floor, so that when it rains, you also get the drippings from the deck above you.We repeatedly asked for a new room, but did not get one until three days later. In all fairness to the hotel staff though, it was a holiday weekend and the place was packed. I do believe they tried (a little) to find another room for us. We also were unaware at the time that the rooms were individually owned, and so assumed that all the rooms were in similar condition. So, when we asked for a new room, we were asking for a room with a king bed (instead of two fulls). We did not bother asking for the room to be cleaned because honestly, it would take more than a few hours to scrub this room and a cleaning will do nothing for that foul and uncomfortable (for seating) futon.On the fourth day, we moved into a new room, D201, which was a VAST improvement over the first room. The second room was clean, it smelled fresh, there were no suspect stains on comforters, and the floors were tidy. The pans were about as worn as the first rooms, but usable. The futon was more comfortable to sit on, was not greasy, and did not reek. The room air conditioners were newer, quieter, and worked better. In all, I think we would have had a very different trip had we skipped the first room. Its hard to relax in a dirty, bad-smelling room.In the case of both rooms, the doors and windows arent really sealed so mosquitoes and bugs will get in. The good news though, is that the mosquitoes move slower than the ones Im used to and they are easy to swat. Both rooms are huge, which is nice. Both rooms had new kitchen appliances and a full-sized refrigerator. While the Bahia Marina site advertises a DVD library from which you can borrow, be advised that not all rooms have DVD players. Our first room did not have a player. Our second room had a DVD player, but it was broken.All the comments on TripAdvisor about the staff being nice and helpful are completely TRUE. The staff is great.warm, friendly, and helpful. The restaurants serve amazing food. We ate at the Dakity Restaurant one night, the Shipwreck Bar and Grill one night, and enjoyed the pool-side service one afternoon. All the meals at the hotel were wonderful. Actually, all the meals during our entire visit to Culebra were wonderful. Barbara Rosas was our favorite (get the fish n chips or grouper, key lime pie, and/or cobbler). Other winners were El Edens sandwiches, Susies, and one of the food stands at Flamenco Beach (the mofongo there was the best of all we tried during our 9 days in Puerto Rico). Parting thought: Zoni Beach is a must-see. Bring your own food and water and unroll a towel under a tree for shade.',neg
'on arrival at the hotel the first thing I noticed was the reception area which is not even 3 star. My gut feeling was that this is not what I had read in the trip advisor reviews. The welcome was medico and for the price of 10000 rupees a night was not what I expected. We were left to our own devices while they prepared our room. We stayed in the pool area which is small but had to find someone to get us a drink - very slack service. The room was nice and spacious and this is really the only positive thing I have to say. At breakfast the next morning I was shocked to be told that I had to pay for a coffee. I had to go to the reception and complain.The buffet was the worst I have seen in any hotel in this price bracket. Even the coffee maker had a bit of sellotape holding it together. The spa area was quite nice and the staff were helpful. I could go on and on about what a let down it was but on a final note Colva is a dirty manic place where people try to rip you off. It is nothing like the kindness and politeness of Patnem , Agonda and Palolem. I would not go back to this area if I was paid. A souless experience',neg

Extremely professional and friendly, I don\'t believe no is part of their vocabulary!A nearby ferry can take you to nearby Fort Kochi for some excellent sightseeing, but the gorgeous infinity pool and spa might keep you at the hotel instead.Room Tip: Recommend the rooms in the new wing facing onto the Dolphin&#39s Point outdoor restaurant.See more room tips',pos

'I have been a regular to this property and I must say, it never ceases to amaze me. There are a few staff members who simply go out of the way to ensure the stay is better than the last time. Vishal - 24 hour restaurant and Arun at the front desk have done the hotel proud.Keep up the good work.',pos
'From the minute we stepped into Vivanta by Taj, Kochi (erstwhile Taj Malabar) in September, my mother and I were made to feel like old friends, back from a hiatus. The picturesque hotel is located on Willingdon Island, and takes about an hour and a quarter from the airport. The solicitous staff ensured our smooth check-in, removing all traces of our fatigue with a most refreshing mint-ginger welcome drink. We were then whisked away to our tastefully done-up corner sunset view sea-side room. The view from the room is gorgeous, and I would recommend other visitors to take one of them sunset view ones. It was sheer delight to see boats and ships of various sizes coursing their way through the Arabian sea, while sipping a cup of Earl grey tea. The evening cruise is a lovely experience, as are the dance performances organized by the hotel daily. The buffet breakfast was good and offered quite a bit of variety. As we had gone to celebrate my mothers birthday, the hotel also made arrangements for a bouquet and a delectable complimentary chocolate cake. We tried all the restaurants in the hotel, and found they all served excellent fare. A special mention to Aquino, the Manager at Rice Boat (a restaurant built on a Kettuvolam)  who smilingly got my mother and me served vegetarian fare in a sea (pun intended) of non vegetarian food. A word of thanks to Mudit too, the Manager at Pepper (the all day diner), who would very thoughtfully get snacks packed for us when we would venture out for sightseeing. We spent four memorable days at the hotel, and returned invigorated from this retreat. Just before checkout, we were also given a memento of Kerala spices. A huge thanks to the entire staff at Taj Kochi for ensuring that my mother and I spent one of our most memorable vacations. We returned invigorated from this retreat after four brilliant days, and have one last word to say about the hotel and its staff  FLAWLESS!Room Tip: Get a sunset room for a stunning viewSee more room tips',pos
'It was a great experience staying at Taj Malabar Cochin. The staff were extremely courteous and nice. They went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The staff from From Desk to Restaurant were extremely nice (The name of few staff I remember - Sumesh Kumar, Ajit, Jenson, Madhu, Sunny, Ashok Eapen(chef),... ). These guys rock. The dining experience was amazing. The staff really cared for the kids too. We had a wonderful stay and my family and I stayed 5 days at the hotel. If we are in Kochi, we will be definitely staying at this hotel and will recommend this hotel to by friends and family. I used to stay at Gateway Taj Marine drive, Ernakulam, But i like Taj Malabar, their staff, service and location much better. Also, the view from the hotel were great.Kudos! keep up the good work guys...Room Tip: I would recommend the Malabar suite or the other suites and the Superior Heritage room with Sea vie...See more room tips',pos
'Great service! I would say taj kochi gave us a beautiful first step into the hospitality and warmth of kerala and its people. Great hotel.sunset cruise organized by the hotel is a must. beautiful rooms that face the sea!. loved it. do stay and enjoy great service!',pos
'The Taj is a place to be pampered as long as you can afford it. The Rice Boat restaurant has the best Kerala style cuisine second to none thanks to executive chef Rasheed. He is the pop star of Kerala cooking and has a wonderful down to earth disposition. Use this hotel as a base, travel by ferry to Fort Cohin and also to central Enarkulam. Recommend an overnight in the tea area about 4 hrs drive and an overnight on a Kerala house boat. The spa is sensational but a little pricey. The daily cultural events and the afternoon tea with the sunset cruise are really well worth it(freebies) Especially the sunsets through the chineses fishing nets captures it all.The breakfast spread is one of the better I have experienced. Travel by local taxi and Tuk Tuk but negotiate price first don\' t get sucked into their agenda be firm about your destination.',pos
'Excellent service. Very cordial staff. Food in the outdoor grill is fantastic. The spa is very good and clean. They have a great evening sunset boat ride and also a private yacht which can be hired for part of the day',pos
'I stayed here for a single night on a business trip. Though I did not have a sea facing room (which they charge extra for), the room I had was very well furnished with a writing desk, and a large comfortable bed. I believe the special rate at that time was just over $100 a night. My travel companion had a sea facing room, which is where the photos are from.The shower had excellent water pressure and there was a electric kettle in the room, which was useful forgetting started early in the morning. The in house restaurant has a bubble roof with a panoramic view of the sea, and very decent food. The fish curry and prawns are highly recommended, The hotel also has a ferry ride to its sister hotel, the Taj Malabar which is supposed to be extremely picturesque. I believe the hotel also has a private beach.I can\'t really comment on the location as we had a car to take us everywhere, but it seemed to be close enough to the main shopping areas, but was at least an hour from the airport.Room Tip: Ask for a sea facing room on the upper floors.See more room tips',pos
'I started searching for a boutique hotel but all were full and ended up at the Taj. Having stayed with this group throughout India I dont know why I doubted them, maybe it was the Vivanta prefix. Anyway the experience was superb with a style of service that is just brilliant. Lovely old world feel to the hotel, the only unfortunate part is the view of the container port is not the most attractive. We went to other highly ranked TA hotels for lunch and did not find them exceptional. India is a fantastic place but a couldn\'t really recommend Cochin. The Cochin city Taj was also very good.VincentRoom Tip: Just check the humidity hasnt left a damp smell in maybe the higher rooms?See more room tips',pos
'My liking of hotel taj malabar goes because of it\'s prominent location, it\'s swimming pool area which is designed as such that it gets mixed with the water shyore of the lake besides which it\'s placed&amp one feels heaven being there.I also liked the design &amp upkeep of the rooms, food is fine.',pos
'Date: 11 September, 2010We are Japanese and have worked in Goa for business. There was a three-day weekend from 10 -12 September, and we decided to trip Kerara.First day, we stayed in a house boat, then next day we stayed in Taj Malabar Hotel.The room was very confatable. Facilities also excellent.I take steam buth and pool. and sanset cruise (complimentary) was very beautiful.',pos
'This hotel is a hidden gem within the luxury hotels found in Kerala. No where else can you experience a view from the top of a man made island: Willingdon Island, overlooking the majestic Vembanad lake.The service and hospitality of the staff at Vivanta by Taj - Malabar is one of the best have encountered. We stayed at the Temptation Suite (Room 119) in the Heritage Wing and the spacious and elaborate suite was perfectly furnished, with every possible luxury one needs. Any and every requirement like Laundry or Room Service is serviced instantly, no need for long waits. The food is fantastic, especially the Kerala cuisine in Pepper &amp Rice Boat (the chef from Rice Boat even made a dish outside the menu simply because we wished for it). Don\'t miss the barbecue at Dolphin Point. An added attraction is that one of India\'s top 10 Spas is located at Jiva Spa in this hotel. During high tide, the Infinity Pool is a sight to behold.Both my wife and myself felt pampered in this hotel and full credit to the staff and the GM for truly transforming our stay into a memorable one.Room Tip: If possible try the Heritage wing suite or the top floor of the Tower wing.See more room tips',pos

'We stayed at The Trident Cochin... one of the other three hotels on Willington Island. We visited the Taj one day and enjoyed a lovely lunch at The Pepper. What an amazing buffet! What superb desserts! His Royal Deliciousness indeed!As for the hotel itself... very warm welcome, lovely enviting lobby, decent pool (including a faux beach area) and nicely manicured grounds, Shame aboutthe view of the shipping yards. Truly detracts from the elegance of the hotel. Nice small gift shop where we purchased a small hand painted art piece. The lobby is old world welcoming with modern touches. Lots of grassed grounds with flora throughout. The Rice Boat Restaurant and the Thai restaurant are both extremely well appointed and inviting. We found the pool area to be only just decent. The stairs seemed somewhat awkward and thought the pool would be better positioned at ground level... yet assumed it was designed so for infinity pool effect.... for the view of the shipping cranes.One instance struck me and has stayed with me. When we entered The Pepper we were asked what our room number was. It came across old school and well questioning our right to dine at the hotel... so, yes, offensive. I guess it has stuck with me as it was asked in such a pretentious fashion by a staff member who was clearly affected with having a job at a Taj. Every other element and staff member was warm and attentive so his approach just did not fit with what we were experiencing. I suggest management instruct staff not to ask for room numbers. It can make the most suitable patrons feel like a couple of suspected dine and dashers.All that stated... it is a lovely hotel with much quailty service. Yet, we are both pleased with our choice to stay at The Trident in a deluxe suite that was surely of a higher caliber than a standard Taj room... and still enjoy the royal delights of the Taj.',pos
'This was a first rate hotel with excellent service and food. The staff were very attentive, friendly and efficient. The rooms were very comfortable and the large lobby/bar is a a real attraction. The situation overlooking the water is stunning and there is a nice garden/al fresco dining area adjacent to the restaurants.Room Tip: Ask for a room overlooking the water.See more room tips',pos
'We stayed at Taj Malabar on the sidelines of a company conference, I brought my family over at the end of the conference and we stayed on for a few days of holiday after the event. The hotel is exceptional in many ways - the views are gorgeous, the rooms are excellent (we had 2 adjoining rooms, one a standard room and the other a suite with a balcony) and the service is absolutely world-class. The attention to detail and willingness to help out with the kids (we have 3 daugthers - 3 1/2, 2 and 1 years old) was superb. In terms of food, there are a lot of choices - the coffee shop buffet has something for everyone, the Thai restaurant is very good, the outdoor seafood grill has exceptional seafood and the indoor local cuisine/ seafood restaurant is very good. All through the restaurant experience however, is the Taj brand of service - very attentive, very helpful and very quick. The hotel is not cheap, but you get your money\'s worth. Overall Vivanta Taj Malabar is a hotel that\'s on our must visit again list.',pos
'We came to the Taj Malabar at the end of a trip to Kerala, very tired. Right from the check-in, the hotel shows how classy it is. We were welcomed with sandalwood marks on our forehead, welcome drinks and two lovely umbrellas for two year old twins. We got upgraded to the top floor Suite, an enormous place for the kids to play hide-and-seek, and the best view in Cochin. Room Service worked very hard to meet all our off-menu requests, and the kids ate as if they were at home for the first time in Kerala.The hotel improvised a dinner table, and served us a spectacular dinner on our private terrace. We took the sunset cruise, which was nice and safe for the children. The hotel has its own yacht, the Taj cinnamon coast, but unfortunately it was booked for the day we stayed. When we return to this hotel, which we surely will, we will try and book it in advance.',pos
'This is the frist time to travel south India.I decided to choose Taj malaba. The frist day i have come to see room and location then decided booking.Warmly welcome from staff. Better than expect at 5 pm start high tea and excursion by boat to see fishing net all inclued room rate no extra charge.I hope i will back again soon.Room Tip: Good views roomSee more room tips',pos
'Taj properties in India are above the rest. Here, we were pleasantly surprised from beginning to end. The staff have this rare ability to offer 5* service in a very classy way but they are also very pleasant to have a side discussion on the city history, the local culture or the latest criquet scores. The views from the room, little attentions, fantastic drinks, the spa treatments, etc. Just above the rest!',pos
'If you really want to see the Indian injunction - Atithi Devo Bhavaha - in practice, you must choose to stay at the Taj Malabar in Cochin. From the moment you step in, till you actually leave, you never feel you are a stranger to the place.Credit goes to the entire staff,and by that, I mean EVERYONE from the reception staff, those who greet you at arrival(thanks Mary Ann), the restaurant managers and staff, the housekeeping folk(the guy on the 5th floor went out of his way to escort me to the pool),the security detail, the people at the Spa(Sri, in particular, was most helpful and dedicated to his yoga duties), to the girl who goes around arranging fresh flowers daily. Mr. Vincent Ramos, the Gen. Manager, is the one from whom this hospitality and care actually percolates downwards.The buffet breakfast was sumptuous and delicious. They actually invited us in on the last day, when it wasn\'t complimentary for us! Thanks Mohit.The Rice Boat is a great place for sea food. Ambience and service was very good.We were on the 5th floor, a corner room with absolutely spectacular views of the port, the bay, and the backwaters. It could not have been better. The rooms are done up with the most modern fittings, and every comfort a traveller could want. The glass fronted bathroom was a delight, \'cause you could look out at the sea while in your bathtub. Great fun!There\'s a wonderful swimming pool, large and clean. The spa serves up a delightful , warm, lemon and gur concoction at all times of the day, the yoga instructor is ever ready to please.The sunset cruise on their own boat was fun and complimentary, tea is served on a large sitout before the cruise.We were there for 3 nights and 4 days. One day there was a total transport strike in Cochin. It was an absolute treat to just stay put, explore the hotel, lounge around , and relax in the cool comfort of our room, reading, watching DVDs, sipping tea, or just staring out at the shimmering waters.The property is beautiful and well laid out. It is probably the oldest in Cochin and has a history of its own. The location is uncrowded and very calm. You can access the local ferry to take you across to the mainland or other islands easily and economically. It\'s great fun!There are so many little thoughtful things they will throw in for you complimentary, even a late checkout if possible, or a dessert after a meal, it makes you feel special.Many staff members were actually present to see us off, including Mr. Ramos. We were so touched! Our only regret is that we did not take a photograph with all of them.Wherever we go, we first look for a Taj hotel, before we look for any other accomodation in the absence of a Taj. Kerala has a large Taj presence. We\'ve always had good experiences! Go for it!I\'m sure there\'s lots more I could have said, but where\'s the space? It\'s difficult to encapsulate the Taj culture.Thank you for a great holiday, Taj Malabar!Room Tip: Corner rooms on higher floors. Definitely go for the sea view rooms.See more room tips',pos
'Kochi (Cochin) is one of the nicest spots in India and the Taj Malabar is a superb hotel with great food and amenities and excellent service. The Chinese/Thai restaurant served one of the best Asian meals we\'ve ever had.',pos
'Great property with excellent sea view. Very good service - loved the 2 nights we stayed there. Buffet is reasonably priced and SPA is good. They have reached a perfect combination of Taj quality with value for money. Will definitely like to go back.',pos
'This is an amazing hotel, with fantastic customer service. The staff make you feel special and would definitely go back there! The complimentary tea service and boat cruise are a definite must! Spa is superb!The rice boat restaurant has delicious food!',pos
'No prize for guessing Taj malabar is one of the best hotel in Cochin. situated very close to cochin port. I have been to cochin more than 10 times and I have stayed at different hotels in cochin especially in MG road. None of the hotel will come closer to Taj Malabar hotel. The restaurant is very good. The hospitality is excellent, The good was very yummy. Truly an impeccable hotel. If you are planning your trip for cochin then better stay at TAJ MALABAR',pos

'I have stayed here a few times. The old wing is lovely beautiful rooms, fantastic service. The restaurants are nice, and the hotel has a really lovely ambiance. Its great for a holiday or for a few days of luxury. The hotel has its own speed boat which can take you over to Fort Kochi. To get to Ernakulam, its quite a long drive, so if you are in Cochin on business, its probably not the most convenient place to stay',pos
'My stay at Novotel Varun Beach was amazing. The hotel is located right on the beach road which is a prime location in Vizag. The best part of the hotel is the view of the ocean from every single room of the property. Not to forget the great infinity pool to relax in. The restaurant \'The Square\' has a great spread and the pizzas are highly recommended. The bar Vue is also a nice place to unwind and relax. The staff at the hotel is very friendly and they are very prompt in helping you in case it is necessary. This hotel is easily the best hotel in Vizag and is definitely recommended.Room Tip: All the rooms have the same excellent view of the ocean. This is the USP of the hotel.See more room tips',pos
'The moment i stepped in the hotel i felt like a royal and was treated like one. There was nothing which I can think off which was even average. The view of the backwaters from the room is just too good. As night falls, the place becomes more radiant and vibrant. To add to the splendour was the great food. The taste of the fish and its delicacy still lingers on my tongue. Thanks for making the stay so comfortable.',pos
'Yes, the hotel is a long way out but without question the service was exceptional. We stayed in 11 hotels while in India and although our stay here was brief the level of service was noted by each of us in our own way. The kids loved that some staff knew their names and the variety of food. Dad enjoyed the High Tea before the sunset cruise and Mum really appreciated the staff dealing with the local travel agent on our behalf. If you like good service, this place exceeded our expectations.',pos
'I stayed here in March for two days with friends. The staff were incredibly helpful in planning our activities in the area. They helped us book a tour inside the reserve. We did a full day trek called border hiking, which is the longest day trek in the reserve. They also helped us book a tribal dance show at night. They were so helpful that they even walked us to the show and to the departure point for the trek to make sure we knew where we were going. Despite poor weather, the pool was also very nice, especially after a long trek! The restaurant serves delicious food, making it a convenient location to have meals. This hotel would be a great location for anyone-couples, friends and even families with children.',pos
'I went there after a 3 day trip at the Taj Kumarakom and it was great. I was traveling with a then 2 year old and the staff couldnt be friendlier. We were upgraded to a corner sea view room which meant we had gorgeous views on 2 sides of the room. The room was a little small but no complaints at all on that front. The pool was perfect and I really enjoyed swimming with my son. A tip: if you\'d like the pool all to yourself, go in at 7 AM. Its bliss. The food was just amazing to say the least and we gorged ourselves. Highly recommend the place though I cant say the same for Kochi - the place has been steadily sliding down and evidenced in Fort Cochin.',pos
'My wife and I stayed for 2 nights at the Vivanta by Taj Malabar Cochin. The service was simply outstanding particularly in the restaurant. Waiters were always watching to see if customers needed any assistance without being overly intrusive. Just the right balance. Food was great, menu was varied. Front desk, bell desk and SPA staff were very good as well. The General Manager was also dropping by to all of the customers and saying hello (Mr. Vincent Ramos). The hotel is located on an island in the middle of Cochin Harbour and has an outstanding view. Can\'t get much better from a venue standpoint. When we left the hotel, we felt as if were leaving family. They even gave us a complimentary snack box for our car trip to Kumarakom. The only downside (and this is a small point) is that the furniture is a bit dated. I suspect they will have to renovate the rooms in a few years.This place lived up the Taj service standards and more. I\'d definitely recommend it.Room Tip: Ask for a sea facingSee more room tips',pos
'Stayed for 3 nights in Jan \'12 with tour group. Hotel is in the port area beside the sea - the immediate location is very pleasant. Our room on the 7th floor had extensive views of the port. Room was spacious and well equipped. Bathroom with tub and shower over. Excellent service and facilities. Sunset cruise to the Chinese fishing nets was a lovely touch. Ate in 3 different restaurants. Particularly impressed by the Rice Bowl - a fish restaurant - excellent personal service and food.',pos
'I don\'t know if this hotel is rated five stars by the standard travel reviews, but it should be. It is really nice. The setting on the Cochin harbor is peaceful and pretty. The place is immaculate--with a wonderful patio. Our dinner at the outdoor restaurant was extremely pleasant. Breakfast the next morning was great. The fitness club is first rate. The swimming pool was small--not long enough for serious laps.Whether it is worth a sidetrip to visit Cochin (form Mumbai or Delhi) is a different question. There is a little Colonial charm left, but not a lot. Efforts to capitalize on the city\'s Jewish past border on the ridiculous the entire Jewish community left the place 70 years ago, and left very little behind. But if you do go to Cochin, you won\'t go wrong staying in this hotel.',pos
'Once you step into the hotel, you are in a different world. Attention to detail within the lounge area is so beautiful - don\'t bother going outside. Morning yoga is a great way to start the day if you are motivated to attempt at a \'pigeon pose\'. Breakfast at the balcony is the way to go and a short swim whenever you can fit into your schedule at the pretty infinity pool. Even better make the time for a massage in the nice and soft treatment bed, not the wooden kind which is also available if you prefer.Room Tip: Window facing east will ensure you wake up to the beautiful and vibrant red sun rise.See more room tips',pos
'Taj Malabar is one of the best hotel in the place called Kochi (Cochin), dubbed as Queen of Arabian Sea, ofcourse in the land of God\'s Own Country - Kerala. The hotel is having both heritage Sea Facing and Normal rooms which mimerise your mind with pristine sea view. One can not erase the memmories if they stays during the monsoon showers which is truly romantic because the first monsoon showers hit Kerala first in India. This is an ideal location for Honeymooners. All you get in a reasonable and affordable tariff. So explore the first mansoon with a blend of heritage hospitality.',pos
'I had an amazing stay at the Park Vizag.Very friendly staffs, private beach, beautiful garden and family friendly hotel in the city center, quite amazing. The buffet breakfast has very good selections. I stayed at the Luxury room, awsome views of the sea, could\'nt have been better. Great value for money paid about 6500rs per night and had WIFI and breakkfast included. I would stay there again soon',pos
'We went to Kochin with a tour and their selection to this hotel was quite nice accomodation.Hotel is located on the Wellington Island with good standards, nice welcoming drink and good Indian food.Hotel has a nice pool and spa facilities.Pillow selection is another nice treatment for the guests.I strongly recommend to see a Kathakali Show at Cochin Cultural Centre which is a four hundred years of story play  with painted faces and nice costumes.',pos
'My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Taj Malabar after being recommended by a friend. We stayed in the old heritage wing which is in the main building. The room was spacious and beautiful. The bed was comfortable, the airconditioning effective and quiet and bathroom with separate shower and bath, clean and spacious. Breakfast was included in our rate and there was a nice selection of foods both western and indian, plua a egg station. One morning we took advantage of the free yoga class, which was not only educational but also a lovely way to start the day.The hotel is a comfortable and less than 10 minutes walk to the Ferry and it cost us 2 Rupee each to travel the less than 5 minute trip over to Fort Cochin. Here we hired a Tuk Tuk driver who for a very modest sum drove us around to all the main tourist sites. The ferry travels on a regular basis back and forth between Willingdon Island where the hotel is and Fort Cochin. If you are looking for a good coffee, try the Solar Cafe which is just 50 metres to the left of the ferry terminal on the Fort Cochin side. Sure you won\'t get a Latte or Cappucino, however you will get freshly brewed filter coffee and I even enjoyed a lovely Iced Coffee. The Cafe offers a small range of meals and we can recommend the French Toast. At 300 Rs for 2 Coffess and 2 French Toast, you cannot go wrong and better still all the food is organic.The thing that sets the Taj Malabar apart is the service. The people were always genuinely happy and always helpful. One morning we choose to sit outside and read our books and within minutes someone arrived to offer us a complimentary coffee. On our last day we departed by car at 5.30am. The Restuarant was open for us with cereals and toast at 5am and they even provided freshly brewed coffee and tea. Better still they packed a box of pastries and fruit for our travel.It is the people that make a difference and at the Taj Malabar the service is simply exceptional.',pos
'looks on its own and it is but it becomes its good point lots to do in hotel and surrounding area of special note was the service to my wife of Supari in reception and Sreejith in yoga and gym loved the free afternoon tea and sunset cruise to the chinese fishing nets great 5 nights there for me and 4 for wife as she did backwater with friend also staying there',pos
'This hotel is tucked away on Wellington Island about a 60 minute drive from the Kochi airport. The rooms look out to the green gardens and the water. A calming and pleasant site. The whole experience since I walked in till I left was beyond my imagination. The attention to detail, the promptness of service and the quality of food, drinks and amenities is to die for. The GM Vincent Ramos is an absolute treasure to the Vivanta Group and his energy and passion runs through the veins of his team as well. All the restaurant managers are polite, polished and offer superb service to each and every guest. I am yet to see a restaurant or a hotel where the management is so hands on and proactive. Also the crew at the gym and spa are top notch. Ahilan at the bar and Jacob at the front desk have an infectious smile and make things happen. All In all a must visit and you will be sad when your trip comes to an end. I cant wait to go back with my friends so they can enjoy this hospitality!',pos

'The Oriental Hotel in Bangkok is rated by many as the best hotel in the world. My wife and I have stayed there, and this hotel beats it (as does the Taj Palace in Mumbai). We spent a week in Kerala the last week of November, landing in Trivandrum and working our way north via car thru the backwater (PhilipKutty Farm), the tea plantation in Munnar (Windermere Estates) and finally Kochi and the Taj Malabar. Kerala itself is a get-away-from-it-all, peaceful corner of the world (except for the driving!!). The action in Kochi is across the water (convenient by ferry), but if you want a gracious retreat, this island Taj in God\'s Own Country is the place to stay. The staff is extremely gracious, bending over backwards to provide unmatched service. The general manager Vincent Ramos has got to be the hardest working man in show business, as he\'s onsite what seems to be 24 by 7. He\'s constantly interacting with staff and guests or on the phone, presumably with suppliers or with his wife, apologizing why he isn\'t home. He took the time to spend more than half an hour with us sharing a drink and his experiences with the Taj and The Four Seasons, where he also worked. He really knows how to run a hotel. I love infinity pools, and the infinity pool here is beautiful, though the pool area is relatively small (a bar takes up much of the space). We did get massages at the spa, which were excellent. We did not take advantage of the sunset cruise, as I hate boats, but the rest of the guests seemed to enjoy it. There are presentations each night (while we were there anyway) of Kerala cultural dances which were very interesting. There are a number of restaurants, with breakfast being particularly good, and a great outdoor dining area literally a few feet from the Arabian Sea. We went to the busy part of Kochi (Fort Kochi I think it\'s called) and found it very interesting. But the Taj was nice to come home to ...Room Tip: Higher floors have a great view over the Arabian Sea.See more room tips',pos
'The best thing about this hotel is the BBQ every day. The setting is beautiful with White lanterns hanging from the trees and little tents/marquees. The service was excellent here and throughout the hotel. For £50 we had as much food as we wanted and it was the best food we had ever had. I actually had extra helpings of the fish and I don\'t ever eat fish at home. Puddings were amazing. We booked the taj for our first 2 nights in Kerala before travelling and we are planning on going back there now for our last night too we loved it so much',pos
'Wonderful hotel, with a very warm and helpful staff. Really relaxing and far away from the madness of Kochi. Nice grounds and services.Rooms are a bit small.',pos
'We stayed (self, wife and eleven year old daughter). The stay in there has been my best holiday in India. We got upgraded to a suit - excellent view. Sipping a cup of tea early morning while seeing the big ships passing by, simply amazing.Each and everyone in the property is like a member of extended family. Always smiling and caringSpeed boat ride was awesome.Must thank Abhiram (front desk). Very few times we come across people with right approach in the service industry. Way to go for other as well (Sumesh in restaurant and the person taking care of swimming pool - sorry I forgot the name but he was a gem who rushed to the market and bough medicine as my daughter was feeling irritating because of the chlorine in the water)Yes, a few points will make this property spotless destination e.g. there are no signages enroute to the hotel, travel team needs to be pushed and guided every time and surely availability of some basic medicines like the eye-drops was missed. I am sure management at the hotel picks up on areas of improvements and that is how you get in to a better place like VIVANTA by TAJ at COCHIFor sure, our next holiday preferred there again',pos
'If you are trawling through a list of higher end hotels in Kochi then stop now and stay here.Pro\'s:- Amazing staff service. I had booked a Sunset View Room which had great views and panaromic glass windows, but was a little too small for my Mom and I. So after speaking to the super helpful reception staff we were moved to a bigger (more expensive - at no extra cost) room with great views and all within a few minutes of asking.But also in general staff were lovely. Actually felt like they wanted you to be happy there.- Hotel: Feels like you are staying in a really luxe colonial mansion. Impecciably decorated, it has the high end hotel feel but still with a very hard to come by homely feeling. Lovely rim flow pool that flows out onto the ocean.- Rooms: Old school comforts, but still really modern. Beautiful wooden floors, big windows, comfy beds - great linen too, plush decor.- Location: You really are on your own Island here. But its not a tropical island, more an industrial island that you share with a few really big factories. But that aside, the location is beautiful and so quiet and calm which is great after the usual hustle and bustle of India. Looking out onto Old Fort Kochi is breathtaking (really). For around 1000 Rupees you can get a hotel car into town ( Old Fort Kochi) or for even less they happily call you a local taxi. Complimentary evening boat ride around the harbor. Quick shuttle boats to the mainland too. - Food: Great selection of restuarants. Basically enough choice that you really don\'t have to leave the Island. It was our last stop on our Indian trip and to be honest being able to stay in a quiet secluded retreat with ample eating selection right on your doorstep could not have come at a better time. Food is a little overprice but great quality and varied selection.Con\'s:- Becareful when getting a shuttle boat to the mainland. Private ones try and charge you 300 Rupees, but if you walk a little further you can get the local ferry for 5 Rupees.- When I saw that it was located on an Island I expected it to have sandy beaches and Palm trees. Not so much. Its more of a man made island with little tropical features, but still no less beautiful.Other then that I really can\'t fault this hotel.',pos
'This hotel is amazing. I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels and visited the other so called luxury establishments in Cochin, Malabar, Old Harbour, Boat House - without a doubt this hotel is another league.Our welcome was perfect. A welcome drink, efficient check in and friendly staff. Just what you need when you finish a long flight.Our room was the usual 5 star luxury with everything you need. We had a huge room at a great rate (3 nights get 1 free and 20\% off all food and drink) with a beautiful bathroom and massive comfortable bed. Our view wasn\'t great but that didn\'t bother me. The views from the hotel were spectacular as was the pool overlooking Fort Cochin.The location is a little annoying if you want to spend a lot of time in Fort Cochin as it\'s a half hour cab ride late at night if you miss the last ferry. Other than that the ferries are cheap and easy and the most efficient ways to get to Fort Cochin.We spent a lot of time at the business centre on the internet sorting our travel. The price was okay obviously not the cheapest. The food at the hotel is sensational - breakfast is amazing and all the other food we had was fantastic, some of the nicest dishes we had on our travels.There was a spa which we didn\'t get time to go to but we met lots of people who had and who recommended it. For me, the biggest selling point of this hotel was the staff - they were phenomonal. Personal - knowing who we were which is impressive in a big busy hotel like the Taj. We visited the other posh hotels for a drink and the staff in comparison were surly and unfriendly. While the staff at the Vivanta really went out of their way and couldn\'t do enough to help us. They came across as genuine and helpful without being overbearing - I was so impressed! The staff at the hotel really made my stay special and I wouldn\'t hesitate to highly recommend this hotel or stay there again.',pos
'Hotel with beautiful furniture and nice and friendly staff. I stayed there with my husband last November and we enjoyed everything. We had meals on all the restaurants and everything was fine. Seafood dinner at open air was unforgettable. Also unforgettable was the kindness of all the staff! We received gifts from both the Spa and Hotel which was a nice touch. If one day we will return - I hope so - we will no doubt stay at this wonderful Hotel!',pos
'Stayed just for a night before we headed to explore kerala, after fyling to Kochi for honeymoon trip with my wife.Everything was perfect, from the warm welcome to a stroll through the whole property and the view of the harbour from the room was just breath taking. The major difference between other hotels and this one is the personalised service..While having any of our meals, maybe at Pepper, which multi-cuisine restaurant , Rice Boat, the speciality restaurant and Thai Pavillion being the chinese speciality restaurant, the one thing common was the prompt and excellent service.The Evening Tea and the Boat Cruise are the icing on the cake which make it this Taj property, one of the best in India.Special mention to all the HOD\'s who were there on their toes during our meals to make sure everything was just PERFECT.Would definately like to come back here again!',pos
'From the moment you arrive it is clear you are in a special place. Efficient staff who deal with requests with a smile. Rooms very well equipped, clean and very comfortable. Food in all restaurants were excellent - try the Rice Boat for a treat and leave the choices to the staff - you will not be disappointed. The pool and garden enables you to watch the world float by (especially with a Kingfisher in hand). Many thanks',pos
'I had the distinct pleasure of staying at the Taj Malabar recently. Coming on the back of my wedding celebrations, I chose the Rice Boat restaurant for an intimate lunch with about two dozen of our closest friends. The F&ampB team along with chef Ashok worked with us to put together a lovely four course menu.We also spent the night in the Deluxe Allure suite. I definitely recommend this room (706). It has a fantastic view and the room is really special. We had a candle lit dinner on the Boat Jetty with a special menu tailored for us. And topped off with a fantastic cup of Chuk Kaapi (spiced coffee). We used the Jiva spa for 90 minute massages the following morning, which was also very goodI have to say that the attention to detail and the level of service we received at this hotel was superlative. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who visits Kerala.',pos
'As kerala is famous for and is called a the land of backwaters we were pretty lucky to find this hotel very near to Kerala back waters.......Their is an boat ride in evening and will give you a beautiful feel and freshness......spacious and clean room......overall a nice experience......',pos
'stayed in the taj malabar in the 2nd week of feb with my wife and kid. have to say the service was excellent. the room was a heritage room with garden view. they had arranged a sunset cruise which was also wonderful. the room is a bit small but very neat. overall a wonderful experience',pos
'I stayed at Cardamom County last spring and had a lovely stay. The service is top-notch. We were given a full tour of the resort (including the wonderful organic garden), had a private yoga lesson twice during our stay, and had a very authentic ayurvedic treatment at the spa. The hotel staffed helped us plan multiple activities for each of the 5 days we were there. The food is delicious and there is a lot of variety. And the pool is a great place to relax after a long hike in the Periyar Reserve. The rooms were very comfortable and nicely appointed. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay!',pos
'We had three nights on a recent pilgrimage visit to the Taj Malabar  Vivanta by Taj now. There was a mix up with the flights, as ours from Mumbai got rescheduled to the evening and by the time we landed at Kochi, it was pretty dark in the evening. We thought and we had been told earlier that the ride would take an hour or less. But our driver  the driver of my vehicle  had a different idea. Rather he had no idea at all, where was the Taj Malabar or for that matter Willingdon Island itself. I had the number of the Gateway, Kochi and its chef Shibhiraj Saha. I talked to him and no sooner than I disconnected, we had the Taj Malabar Front Office Manager Rupesh Sarode online and he guided us through the rest of our way until we reached the hotel at about 1100 pm. At the hotel, we had a nice reception and we were taken to room 114, the sea-facing room in the heritage wing. We had a huge rectangular room, ornate in appearance and utilitarian in approach. A plasma TV, a writing table, WIFI, flowers for our deity worship, fruit basket, cookies, a bottle of Indian wine and the works. Newspapers and magazines of my choice. Only the Pepper, the 24 hours coffee house was open when we came down after our worship and it was just rice and Alleppey fish curry for the night. Sumptuous and delicious. But after eight hours of peaceful  they had perfected the art of pillow mantra  we had a invigorating breakfast. We had to rush to Chottanikkara on our pilgrimage. The darshan was not very great as we hardly had a few seconds of it before the gates closed.The lunch was not very great but the dinner at the Riceboat was great. It is an exclusive seafood restaurant. WYSIWIG. You select a fish or crab and they make it to order. We had a fish fry and Alleppey fish curry. Both were great. A word about the hotel house keeping  superb. Every corner was squeaky clean. Generous replacement of cookies, water, fruits and tea sachets of your choice. The staff are extra complaint. Never grumbling even at the most eccentric requests. We had ours too. The hotel arranges an evening boat ride on a motorized boat up to Vypeen Islands. We had availed it when we stayed at the Gateway Ernakulam the last time. Moreover it was raining. So we skipped out. But the Jiva Spa was one thing we couldn\'t afford to miss. The spa, Jacuzzi and the pool are as great as those of any Taj hotel. The best thing about the hotel is its staff. Always with a captivating smile. Not one could we find disgruntled or indifferent. There was Jayant Das, the F&ampB Manager who went out of way when my wife demanded rice kheer, jaggery payas and raw milk all the three days our stay for our worship. Even the security staff guided you through your driving directions.The checkout was smooth too. I had an American Express Gift certificate for ten grand and the rest by credit card. The staff accompanied by Jayant Das, Abhiram Menon and Rupesh Sarode saw us off at the porch. They bellboys kept our luggage in the boot and we drove off to our next destination. In all, a memorable stay. A special thanks to Mudit Mathur who led our culinary journey in the all-day restaurant, complying all the whimsical needs of my wife. A special thanks to Mathew and Prabhakar from the house keeping. A special thanks to Ms. Jasmine Luiz, the Accommodations Manager at the Taj Kovalam, who made our stay the Taj Malabar a memorable one. A big thank you tp Jagat Singh, Gateway, Ramgarh Lodge, who recommended me to tho this hotel. Like a good coffee, the memories of a Taj stay lingers in the mind till you get a better experience when some other Taj hospitality catches up with you.',pos
'Its a lovely hotel having a good location.Very professional, courteous and friendly staff. Rooms are good and well maintained. Elevators could have been looked into though. I was there for one day for my business trip in Vizag and I must say that thoroughly enjoyed staying at The Park Hotel.I preferred to dine in the restaurant close to the beach and was very well attended by the restaurant guys. Great food followed with equally matching service.Overall the staffs are very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. I wished I could have stretched my trip to enjoy being pampered. I am surely going to recommend this hotel to my friends &amp family.Thank you The Park Hotel Guys for making my stay worth. Looking forward to come back soon this time with family for sure.',pos

'We stayed 6 night in a Deluxe room number 302 with view of the harbour its was very nice clean room with all the facilities. Staff are very very friendly with my child and made the child very happy and they cooked food for the child at any time we want and it was free of charge. Staff are very helpful and always with lot of smile and food was very good and i had a massage in the spa its was very good, and well keptWe eat in all the restaurant they had and the food was very good and specialy in the Rice boat retaurant is our favorite.At the end they cooked a sepcial take away lunch pack for our child and its was very kind to have this because the time we left.We will be back very soon in Nov 2011Sassi &amp family from Sri lanka',pos

'We stayed at Taj Malabar at the start of our week long visit to Kerala. The best start to our vacation. From The management who helped relocate us from another property that did not deliver as advertised, to the staff who anticipated and delivered on our requests to the location that was just perfect overlooking the water. Our kids were entertained by the staff with fishing off the dock and a wonderful pool experience. This is THE PLACE to stay in Fort Kochi.',pos
'The Taj Malabar hotel was fabulous from start to finish. The service from the moment we stepped through the doors was second to none. We dined at several of the restaurants and found the food to be of an extremely high standard. The spa facilities were excellent and we experienced a great massage with friendly and professional service. We arranged to go on a Rice boat overnight to see the backwaters and booked through the travel desk who were so helpful and even arranged a speedboat transfer. The rooms were of a high standard and were very clean. The location was a little far from the center of the city but we found the local ferry quite an experience and very accessible to go to fort Cochin. The only negative thing I could say is that the noise from the pesky crows was slightly annoying. Would recommend to anyone travelling around this part of India.',pos
'What a beautifull hotel in beautifull city cochin. Water front hotel good view of cochin harbour. Select a sea facing room for stay you can enjoy the sun set. Good varity of cusine. should try kerala cusine especially fresh sea foods. enjoy evenings in the beach side.

Very nice hotel to stay in cochin for lesiure as well as busines travellers.',pos
'our recent stay at Taj Malabar was an absolutely awesome experience, I usually Travel on Business and this time around took my family with me....the location itself is soooo beautiful and cannot be described with words. The view of the Harbour, endless water, the evening cruise, the food, the Wonderful Staff!!! the property by itself...gave us an overall exhilarating experience. I\'d like to share this one... when having breakfast on morning, I had asked for Baked Yogurt which is a Taj speciality...but they didn\'t have it that day :( and the manager there promised that he\'ll arrange for it the next morning. But we had to leave the next morning and we skipped breakfast as we had to pack and leave to the airport on time... somehow the same Manager spotted me and asked me if I\'m going to have breakfast...when I said no and that we\'d already checked out...he insisted that we have breakfast and that the chef had prepared the Baked Yogurt just for me!!! I felt very special and I was made to have the baked yogurt and they packed Breakfast for all of us to have on the way to the airport. ..I am waiting to get back there again on my next trip to Cochin!!!Room Tip: ask for the sea facing roomsSee more room tips',pos
'I was in Hyderabad, India for work and went to Vizag for two days. After doing a lot of research on hotels in Vizag, the Park seemed a good option as its closest to the sea. I wasn\'t sure if it would be a quiet place though. Usually hotels near beaches are noisy and overcrowded with tourists. But staying at this hotel was wonderful. The place is so quiet that in the night you can even hear the sound of the waves. I had a very relaxing time which helped as the rest of my trip was very busy. The staff is friendly and polite. This is something which you don\'t find in hotels in US. Staff here goes out of their way to meet your requirements. The service is top class to say the least. Pool side is great too with nice pine trees (chk pic) and just having a beer by the pool is a great way to relax. I have also stayed few yrs back at their Delhi property and this experience was a lot better (but then I went to Delhi for work not leisure). The day I was checking out, I also saw few families check in to the hotel. One of their staff told me that a lot of groups and families visit this hotel to unwind during holidays. Overall, a great place to relax and enjoy your stay. Highly recommended for a stopover during a business trip.',pos
'We (wife, kid daughter &amp me) spent a long weekend (Thu-27th Oct11to Sun-30th Oct11) at the Taj Malabar Cochin. The Service was awesome. Each of the staff makes such an effort to ensure your stay is comfortable &amp every need is satisfied. A special Thank you to Mudith from the Peppers Coffee Shop! Packing a few snacks for my daughter for our excursions was a very thoughtful gesture. Really appreciated! Food at the Peppers Coffee shop was very good. The Thai restaurant was ok, felt a bit pricey for the level of food. We were given a corner room on the 6th floor with a fantastic view. Quite an enjoyable experience to view the sunrise-sunset &amp see a huge warship rub shoulders with small ferry boats! The room felt a bit small, but on the whole it was nice.Pool, Spa, Gym - All were great &amp we had a wonderful time here.The stay was worth the price we paid!Room Tip: Go for the Sea facing &amp corner rooms on the higher floors!See more room tips',pos
'5 star for sure. Loved the welcome drink. Had dinner at rice boat which is the best dinner we had during our trip to India. They took me inside their kitchen and it was spic and span. The departure was incredible. The whole staff waved us goodbye including the manager of the property. That\'s service.',pos
'where should I start from??Once you are here, forget about the rest of world. Because TAJ does it again. Being of the best hotels of Kochi, Taj Malabar is astounding in all terms. What else does anyone want? Think of anything you expect from a hotel, this one comes up with many more, beyond your imaginations.Being located in Willingdon Island, the view of the cochin harbour is awesome and the don\'t forget the sunset. Services are not at all a question, you\'ll get the best.Do visit this place if you are on leisure trip, because you need to cherish your moments at Taj Malabar.Room Tip: Do visit this place, nothing else.See more room tips',pos

'I stayed at this hotel in June\'11 for 2 nights with my wife and 6-year old daughter. We had booked this hotel for the first 2 days of our 11-day trip to Kerala, Kochi being the port of entry. We had already heard really nice things about the location and the view from the Hotel from a few friends and were really looking forward to the stay.And I must say it was a wonderful experience staying at this property. Very warm and hospitable staff. Right from my request for an early check-in to request for special meal, everything was handled very professionally and promptly. Very efficient check-in, most refreshing welcome drink. The sea facing suites are superb, really fantastic views. The room has all the modern amenities to make stay luxurious. The view from the Balcony was mesmerizing. The Sunset Cruise is a must. Very neat Spa and \'infinity\' pool area. Food is good..especially the breakfast buffet. Very nice and helpful Staff very very friendly with kids and made my daughter very happy. They even got a special packed takeaway B\'fast, on the day of our checkout as we were headed to Munnar. I only stayed for two nights, and being a vegetarian, couldn\'t try the Riceboat restaurant, even though the chef offered to make something veg for me. Definitely going to do that on my next trip.In all, a memorable stay. Special thanks to Mudit Mathur and Sumesh, who took special care of us and my daughter in the all-day restaurant.. A special thanks to Mr. Vincent who not only promptly got me an early checkin, but upgraded me to a suite and made our stay at the Taj Malabar a truly memorable one.Room Tip: Sunset view / Sea facing Suites are the bestSee more room tips',pos
'The food is awesome - try the Fish Stew with aapams from the Rice Boat restaurant. The rooms in the heritage wing open to the lush green gardens with a beautiful view of the harbor. The sunset cruise is a must do and try the complimentary snacks provided before getting on the cruise. Prompt service and well groomed staff....',pos

'I had a wonderful leisurely stay at Taj Malabar, Cochin. I was in the new wing with wonderful views of the water from both windows. The hotel has wonderful amenities with a home theatre syatem attached to the LCD TV, a waterfront buffet for dinner, a restaurant in the shape of a boat called the rice boat, DVD library, etc. The hotel also provides a complmentary boat cruise. I would have loved to stay longer but unfortunately I was there for only one night. The service was also excellent and I had dinner in the Thai Pavilion which was also a culinary treat.Room Tip: Ask for the sea view roomsSee more room tips',pos
'When I arrived at Cochin I had a reservation with taj malabar.. A disappointment with the hotel is it is too far from the city.... But as soon as you enter the gate of the hotel you feel that this is the only hotel to stay in the whole of Cochin. After check in we headed for lunch. The tuvar ki dal, dahi idli and the laccha parantha we\'re absolutely mind blowing. We were upgraded to the back water facing room and believe me it was the best. The sunset cruise was fabulous and before boarding the cruise we were offered brownies, tea, coffe and muffins. Truly a taj experience.',pos
'My father lives in Cochin and while visiting him this summer we came here several times which was a real treat. The service is impeccable from beginning to end and the food is delicious - I always end up eating too much ! After a month and a half in Cochin, I have to say that the Thai Pavillion is probably my favourite restaurant in Kerala and it has always been a pleasure to come. Nothing seems too much trouble for the staff who make a great effort to ensure your time there is enjoyable and who certainly seem to genuinely care. I finished a 6 month trip travelling around the world with a meal at the Taj andI could not think of a better way to end.',pos
